Our goal is to motivate why most physicists and astrophysicists accept the hypothesis that the most massive, compact objects seen in many astrophysical systems are described by the black hole solutions of general relativity. We describe the nature of the most important black hole solutions, the Schwarzschild and the Kerr solutions. We discuss gravitational collapse and stability in order to motivate why such objects are the most likely outcome of realistic astrophysical collapse processes. Finally, we discuss some of the observations which -- so far at least -- are totally consistent with this viewpoint, and describe planned tests and observations which have the potential to falsify the black hole hypothesis, or sharpen still further the consistency of data with theory.", "published": "2005-11-17T16:26:58+00:00", "updated": "2024-04-27T15:47:57+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0511217v3", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0511217v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0511217v3"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "hep-ph", "categories": ["hep-ph", "astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

We analyze the evolution of 512 unique, first-infalling jellyfish galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These have been visually inspected to be undergoing RPS sometime in the past 5 billion years (since $z=0.5$), have satellite stellar masses $\\mstarsat\\sim10^{8-10.5}\\,M_\\odot$, and live in hosts with $\\mvir\\sim10^{12-14.3}\\,M_\\odot$ at $z=0$. We quantify the cold gas ($T\\leq10^{4.5}$ K) removal using the tracer particles, confirming that for these jellyfish, RPS is the dominant driver of cold gas loss after infall. Half of these jellyfish are completely gas-less by $z=0$, and these galaxies have earlier infall times and smaller satellite-to-host mass ratios than their gaseous counterparts. RPS can act on jellyfish galaxies over long time scales of $\\approx1.5-8$ Gyr. Jellyfish in more massive hosts are impacted by RPS for a shorter time span and, at a fixed host mass, jellyfish with less cold gas at infall and lower stellar masses at $z=0$ have shorter RPS time spans. While RPS may act for long periods of time, the peak RPS period -- where at least 50 pecent of the total RPS occurs -- begins within $\\approx1$ Gyr of infall and lasts $\\lesssim2$ Gyr. During this period, the jellyfish are at host-centric distances $\\sim0.2-2\\rvir$, illustrating that much of RPS occurs at large distances from the host galaxy. Interestingly, jellyfish continue forming stars until they have lost $\\approx98$ percent of their cold gas. For groups and clusters in TNG50 $(\\mvirhost\\sim10^{13-14.3}\\,M_\\odot)$, jellyfish galaxies deposit more cold gas ($\\sim10^{11-12}\\,M_\\odot$) into halos than exist in them at $z=0$, demonstrating that jellyfish, and in general satellite galaxies, are a significant source of cold gas accretion.", "published": "2023-04-18T18:00:02+00:00", "updated": "2024-04-16T12:37:34+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09196v2", "doi": "10.1093/mnras/stad2101", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad2101", "http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09196v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09196v2"], "journal_reference": "MNRAS, 524, 3502-3525 (2023)", "primary_category": "astro-ph.GA", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"]}

Nevertheless, some, but not all, observations suggest that jellyfish galaxies exhibit enhanced star formation compared to control samples, even in their ram pressure-stripped tails. We use the TNG50 cosmological gravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulation, with an average spatial resolution of 50-200 pc in the star-forming regions of galaxies, to quantify the star formation activity and rates (SFRs) of more than 700 jellyfish galaxies at $z=0-1$ with stellar masses $10^{8.3-10.8}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in hosts with mass $10^{10.5-14.3}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

We compare the findings for jellyfish galaxies to those of diversely-constructed control samples, including against satellite and field galaxies with matched redshift, stellar mass, gas fraction and host halo mass. According to TNG50, star formation and ram-pressure stripping can indeed occur simultaneously within any given galaxy, and frequently do so. Moreover, star formation can also take place within the ram pressure-stripped tails, even though the latter is typically subdominant. However, TNG50 does not predict elevated population-wide SFRs in jellyfish compared to analog satellite galaxies with the same stellar mass or gas fraction. Simulated jellyfish galaxies do undergo bursts of elevated star formation along their history but, at least according to TNG50, these do not translate into a population-wide enhancement at any given epoch.", "published": "2023-04-18T18:00:03+00:00", "updated": "2023-11-02T11:53:42+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09199v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09199v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09199v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph.GA", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"]}

Sanchez"], "summary": "We uncover the general mechanism producing the dark energy(DE). This is only based on well known quantum physics and cosmology. We show that the observed DE originates from the cosmological quantum vacuum of light particles which provides a continuous energy distribution able to reproduce the data. Bosons give positive contributions to the DE while fermions yield negative contributions. As usual in field theory, ultraviolet divergences are subtracted from the physical quantities. The subtractions respect the symmetries of the theory and we normalize the physical quantities to be zero for the Minkowski vacuum. The resulting finite contributions to the energy density and the pressure from the quantum vacuum grow as log a(t) where a(t) is the scale factor, while the particle contributions dilute as 1/a^3(t), as it must be for massive particles. The DE equation of state P = w(z)H turns to be w(z)<-1 with w(z) asymptotically reaching the value -1 from below.A scalar particle can produce the observed DE through its quantum cosmological vacuum provided:(i)its mass is of the order of 10^{-3} eV = 1 meV,(ii) it is very weakly coupled and (iii) it is stable on the time scale of the age of the universe. The axion vacuum thus appears as a natural candidate. The neutrino vacuum (especially the lightest mass eigenstate) can give negative contributions to the DE. We find that w(z=0) is slightly below -1 by an amount ranging from [-1.5 10^{-3}] to [-8 10^{-3}] and we predict the axion mass to be in the range between 4 and 5 meV. We find that the universe will expand in the future faster than the de Sitter universe, as an exponential in the square of the cosmic time.

Accretion rates onto stellar mass black holes range over more than sixteen orders of magnitude, from the lower luminosity BHXRB to GRB. These enormous parameter ranges correspond to qualitative as well as quantitative differences in behavior. The fundamental questions involve the balance between nonequilibrium and thermalized plasmas. When energy fluxes exceed a critical value $\\sim 10^{29}$ erg/cm$^2$s, as in GRB, a black-body equilibrium pair plasma forms. At the lower fluxes found in AGN, BHXRB and microquasars, accretion power electrodynamically accelerates a small number of very energetic particles, explaining their non-thermal spectra and the high energy gamma-ray emission of blazars. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays may be accelerated by massive black holes, otherwise undetectable, with very low thermal luminosities. New-born fast high-field pulsars may be in the black-body equilibrium regime, resembling SGR in permanent outburst. I also consider the question, significant for the acceleration of nonthermal particles in GRB outflows, of whether collisionless plasmas interpenetrate rather than forming hydrodynamic shocks, and propose this as an alternative to internal shock models of GRB.

Roscoe"], "summary": "Leibniz considered the notion of the 'empty physical space' to be a meaningless abstraction, and he held firmly to the view that the only significant thing was the set of relationships between 'objects', whatever these 'objects' might be. Similarly, he was equally clear in expressing his views about Newton's universal time, which he also considered to be a meaningless abstraction. In effect, for him, time was no more than a synonym for ordered change within a material system. The process of giving quantitative realization to this duality of non-Newtonian ideas forms the core of this work. A primary result arising is that every gravitating particle is no more than a clock - the geometric Leibniz Clock - which provides all the basic things: it conserves energy and angular momentum and satisfies the Weak Equivalence Principle. When the Clock is applied to model the concept of a galactic object within which all motions are circular, the characteristic properties of the MOND galaxy (asymptotic flatness, a critical acceleration scale, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship) are quantitatively reproduced in the resulting Leibniz galaxy. In short, the characteristic essence of MOND has its source in the geometric Leibniz Clock.", "published": "2008-02-20T16:16:22+00:00", "updated": "2022-04-29T15:14:09+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.2889v6", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2889v6", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.2889v6"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We redo the calculation of the energy in the region where the string overlaps itself near a cusp, which is the maximum energy that can be released in radiation.

We show that in addition to variations of the normalization of the luminosity function, a steepening of its slope is also expected in underdense fields, similarly to what is observed within voids in the local universe.

What is the origin of this quasi-periodicity? What is the nature of the global events that define the boundaries of the geological time scale? I propose that a single mechanism is responsible for all three types of such events: mass extinctions, geomagnetic polarity reversals, and sea-level fluctuations. The mechanism is fast, and involves a significant energy release. The mechanism is unlikely to have astronomical causes, both because of the energies involved, and because it acts quasi-periodically. It must then be sought within the Earth itself. And it must be capable of reversing the Earth's magnetic field. The last requirement makes it incompatible with the consensus model of the origin of the geomagnetic field - the hydromagnetic dynamo operating in the Earth's fluid core. In the second part of the paper, I show that a vast amount of seemingly unconnected geophysical and geological data can be understood in a unified way if the source of the Earth's main magnetic field is a ~200-km-thick lithosphere, repeatedly magnetized as a result of methane-driven oceanic eruptions, which produce ocean flow capable of dynamo action. The eruptions are driven by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas, which accumulates in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia. Polarity reversals, mass extinctions, and sequence boundaries are consequences of these eruptions. Unlike the consensus model of geomagnetism, this scenario is consistent with the paleomagnetic data showing that \"directional changes during a [geomagnetic polarity] reversal can be astonishingly fast, possibly occurring as a nearly instantaneous jump from one inclined dipolar state to another in the opposite hemisphere\".", "published": "2003-12-24T19:36:23+00:00", "updated": "2018-10-26T15:03:16+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0312617v2", "doi": "10.1088/0034-4885/73/12/122801", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/73/12/122801", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0312617v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0312617v2"], "journal_reference": "Reports on Progress in Physics 73, 122801 (2010)", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "astro-ph.EP", "physics.geo-ph"]}

A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at Cerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second exposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given night. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000 square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$ point-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with $\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\\sim27.5$. The remaining 10\\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey.

Tsui"], "summary": "The designation of the customary restricted three-body disturbing potential $\\Phi$ as the perturbation Hamiltonian is believed to be the cause of Neptune ring arcs' radial offset between theories and observations. To identify the appropriate perturbation Hamiltonian, the energy integral in the fixed frame of a restricted three-body system, consisting of the central, primary, and test bodies, is reconsidered. It is shown that the perturbation energy includes the disturbing potential $\\Phi$ and the potential arising from the angular momentum terms of the test body. Both potentials happen to be singular as the test body goes to infinity contradicting to the perturbation nature. These two potentials can be combined to an energy relevant disturbing potential $\\Phi^{*}=\\beta\\Phi$ which is regular at infinity because of the cancellation of the singularities. For circular orbits of the primary, the energy equation is conservative, and $\\Phi^{*}$ is identified as the perturbation Hamiltonian. Applying this result to evaluate the backgrund effect of Triton to the arc-Galatea system of Neptune, it is shown that there is a small difference $\\Delta\\Phi=(\\Phi^{*}-\\Phi)$ which amounts to an outward radial offset of the corotation location of Galatea by 0.3 Km. The mismatch between the pattern speed of Galatea's corotation potential and the mean motion velocity of the arcs could be resolved by considering the finite mass of Fraternite. However, by using $\\Phi^{*}$, Galatea's eccentricity could be reassessed in terms of the mass of Fraternite.", "published": "2005-03-01T19:41:00+00:00", "updated": "2018-05-04T20:36:16+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503025v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503025v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503025v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range 10^6-10^10 Msun. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z>10, could be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive black holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If the black hole descendants of the primordial stars exist, their mergers with nearby supermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark matter halos in LambdaCDM universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter halos with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host halos and the implications of black hole's kick velocities arising from their coalescence. The central concentration of low mass early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km/s. Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the largest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free stars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies.", "published": "2006-09-15T16:16:43+00:00", "updated": "2017-12-05T20:17:48+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0609443v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609443v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0609443v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The new formalism provides an elementary statistical explanation of the modal broadening phenomenon in single pulse observations. It is also used to argue that the degree of polarization of giant pulses has been poorly defined in past studies. Single and giant pulse polarimetry typically involves sources with large flux densities and observations with high time resolution, factors that necessitate consideration of source-intrinsic noise and small-number statistics. Self noise is shown to fully explain the excess polarization dispersion previously noted in single pulse observations of bright pulsars, obviating the need for additional randomly polarized radiation. Rather, these observations are more simply interpreted as an incoherent sum of covariant, orthogonal, partially polarized modes. Based on this premise, the four-dimensional covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters may be used to derive mode-separated pulse profiles without any assumptions about the intrinsic degrees of mode polarization. Finally, utilizing the small-number statistics of the Stokes parameters, it is established that the degree of polarization of an unresolved pulse is fundamentally undefined; therefore, previous claims of highly polarized giant pulses are unsubstantiated.

Hanson", "N. P. Abel", "G. J. Ferland", "H. B. Nemala", "G. Shaw", "T. H. Troland"], "summary": "The southwestern (SW) part of the Galactic H II region M17 contains an obscured ionization front that is most easily seen at infrared and radio wavelengths. It is nearly edge-on, thus offering an excellent opportunity to study the way in which the gas changes from fully ionized to molecular as radiation from the ionizing stars penetrates into the gas. M17 is also one of the very few H II regions for which the magnetic field strength can be measured in the photodissociation region ( PDR) that forms the interface between the ionized and molecular gas. Here we model an observed line of sight through the gas cloud, including the H+, H0 (PDR), and molecular layers, in a fully self-consistent single calculation. An interesting aspect of the M17 SW bar is that the PDR is very extended. We show that the strong magnetic field that is observed to be present inevitably leads to a very deep PDR, because the structure of the neutral and molecular gas is dominated by magnetic pressure, rather than by gas pressure, as previously had been supposed.We also show that a wide variety of observed facts can be explained if a hydrostatic geometry prevails, in which the gas pressure from an inner X-ray hot bubble and the outward momentum of the stellar radiation field compress the gas and its associated magnetic field in the PDR, as has already been shown to occur in the Orion Nebula. The magnetic field compression may also amplify the local cosmic-ray density. The pressure in the observed magnetic field balances the outward forces, suggesting that the observed geometry is a natural consequence of the formation of a star cluster within a molecular cloud.", "published": "2006-11-27T15:22:57+00:00", "updated": "2017-08-01T16:57:17+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611808v2", "doi": "10.1086/511258", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/511258", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611808v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611808v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Pulse arrival times are typically measured using only the observed total intensity light curve. The new technique exploits the additional timing information available in the polarization of the pulsar signal by modeling the transformation between two polarized light curves in the Fourier domain. For a number of millisecond pulsars, arrival time estimates derived from polarimetric data are predicted to exhibit greater precision and accuracy than those derived from the total intensity alone.

Modjaz"], "summary": "(Original) Recent high-resolution spectra of the Type Ia SN 2006X have revealed the presence of time-variable and blueshifted Na I D features, interpreted by Patat et al. as originating in circumstellar material within the progenitor system. The variation seen in SN 2006X induces relatively large changes in the total Na I D equivalent width ($\\Delta\\rm{EW}\\approx 0.5 \\unicode{x212B}$ in just over two weeks), that would be detectable at lower resolutions. We have used a large data set comprising 2400 low-resolution spectra of 450 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the CfA Supernova Program to search for variable Na I D features. Out of the 31 SNe Ia (including SN 2006X) in which we could have detected similar EW variations, only one other (SN 1999cl) shows variable Na I D features, with an even larger change over a similar ~10-day timescale ($\\Delta\\rm{EW} = 1.66 \\pm 0.21 \\unicode{x212B}$). Interestingly, both SN 1999cl and SN 2006X are the two most highly-reddened objects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability is connected to dusty environments. (Erratum) The large variation in the Na I D equivalent width observed in SN 1999cl results in fact from a measurement error. Our new measurements show that the EW variation is significantly lower, at $0.43 \\pm 0.14 \\unicode{x212B}$. While the EW variation remains statistically significant (3.1$\\sigma$ different from zero), it is now below the detection threshold of 0.5 $\\unicode{x212B}$ derived from the Monte Carlo simulations published in the original paper. As a result, SN 1999cl should no longer be considered as an object displaying variable Na I D lines in our study. The fraction of SNe Ia in our sample displaying Na I D lines thus goes from $\\sim$6% (2/31) in the original study to $\\sim$3% (1/31) in the revised analysis, SN 2006X being the only SN Ia in our sample with variable Na I D lines.", "published": "2008-10-31T20:00:35+00:00", "updated": "2017-07-10T12:37:28+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0002v3", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/693/1/207", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/693/1/207", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0002v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0002v3"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.693:207-215,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The fitting of stellar radial velocity time series data is attempted by constructing a model to quantify the orbital properties of a star-planetary system. This is achieved with the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP). Though specific to the investigated problem, the POFP is founded on two separate, more general ideas. One is a Solver producing the gravitational dynamics of a Three-Body system by integrating its Newtonian equations of motion. The other is an independent optimisation scheme. Both have been devised using MATLAB. Applying the optimisation to the Solver results in a realistic Three-Body dynamics that best describes the radial velocity data under the model-specific orbital-observational constraints. Combining these aspects also allows for the study of dynamical instability derived from interaction, which is reaffirmed as a necessary criterion for evaluating the fit. The validity of POFP solutions with respect to the observations and other models is discussed in this context.

After their number density has frozen out in the early universe, determining their relic density today, WIMPs are still kept very close to thermal equilibrium by scattering events with standard model particles. The complete decoupling from the thermal bath happens as late as around 1-10 MeV, thereby setting an important cosmological scale that can directly be translated into a small-scale cutoff of the spectrum of matter density fluctuations. We present here a full analytic treatment of the kinetic decoupling process from first principles.

As an application, we consider the situation of the lightest supersymmetric particle as well as the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle that arises in theories with universal extra dimensions; furthermore, we show that our formalism can also easily be applied to, e.g., the evolution of the non-relativistic electrons into the recombination regime.

However, 17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the inclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox observations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing this problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own, using the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of data, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct length. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to modern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called 'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that procedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average) value of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho Brahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750, Newton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the same regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the founding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble (1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.", "published": "2008-10-27T21:55:27+00:00", "updated": "2016-02-04T08:50:35+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4948v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4948v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.4948v2"], "journal_reference": "Observatory, 2016 February, Vol. 136, No. 1250, pp. 1-22", "primary_category": "physics.hist-ph", "categories": ["physics.hist-ph", "astro-ph"]}

In the context of inflationary cosmology, this implies that the CMB data are now sensitive to the form of the inflaton potential. Most of the current approaches devoted to the derivation of the inflationary primordial power spectra, or to the inflaton potential reconstruction problem, rely on approximate analytical treatments that may break down for exotic models. In this article, we numerically solve the inflationary evolution of both the background and all the perturbed quantities to extract the primordial power spectra exactly. Such a method solely relies on General Relativity and linear perturbation theory. More than providing a tool to test analytical approximations, one may consider, without complications, the treatment of non-standard inflationary models as those involving several fields, eventually non-minimally coupled to gravity. The usefulness of the exact numerical approach to deal with CMB data is illustrated by analysing the WMAP third year data in the context of single field models. For this purpose, we introduce a new inflationary related parameter encoding the basic properties of the reheating era. This reheating parameter has significant observable effects and provides a self-consistency test of inflationary models.

In particular, the duality symmetries of string theory suggest scenarios in which the Universe starts inflating from an initial state characterized by very small curvature and interactions. Such a state, being gravitationally unstable, will evolve towards higher curvature and coupling, until string-size effects and loop corrections make the Universe \"bounce\" into a standard, decreasing-curvature regime. In such a context, the hot big bang of conventional cosmology is replaced by a \"hot big bounce\" in which the bouncing and heating mechanisms originate from the quantum production of particles in the high-curvature, large-coupling pre-bounce phase. Here we briefly summarize the main features of this inflationary scenario, proposed a quarter century ago. In its simplest version (where it represents an alternative and not a complement to standard slow-roll inflation) it can produce a viable spectrum of density perturbations, together with a tensor component characterized by a \"blue\" spectral index with a peak in the GHz frequency range.

Observed with the SMA, the 875 micron continuum emission exhibits a shell-like morphology similar to longer wavelengths. By using images with comparable angular resolution at five frequencies obtained from the VLA archive and CARMA, we have removed the free-free component from the 875 micron image. We find five sources of dust emission: two compact warm objects (SMA1 and SMA2) along the periphery of the shell, and three additional regions further out. There is no dust emission inside the shell, supporting the picture of a dust-free cavity surrounded by high density gas. At subarcsecond resolution, most of the molecular gas tracers encircle the UCHII region and appear to constrain its expansion. We also find G5.89-0.39 to be almost completely lacking in organic molecular line emission. The dust cores SMA1 and SMA2 exhibit compact spatial peaks in optically-thin gas tracers (e.g. 34SO2), while SMA1 also coincides with 11.9 micron emission. In CO(3-2), we find a high-velocity north/south bipolar outflow centered on SMA1, aligned with infrared H2 knots, and responsible for much of the maser activity. We conclude that SMA1 is an embedded intermediate mass protostar with an estimated luminosity of 3000 Lsun and a circumstellar mass of ~1 Msun. Finally, we have discovered an NH3 (3,3) maser 12 arcsec northwest of the UCHII region, coincident with a 44 GHz CH3OH maser, and possibly associated with the Br gamma outflow source identified by Puga et al.

Also Hubble (1929) called the discovered distance-redshift relation as \"De Sitter effect\". For homogeneous matter distribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of distance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the fractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function of distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the Hubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal cosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles. The first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the gravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual unity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the relativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is that the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales up to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is assumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is the explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all three phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale structure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large scale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter without nonbaryonic matter and dark energy.", "published": "2008-10-01T13:25:58+00:00", "updated": "2015-03-11T18:10:25+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.0162v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0162v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.0162v2"], "journal_reference": "Practical Cosmology, v.2, pp.60-67, 2008", "primary_category": "gr-qc", "categories": ["gr-qc", "astro-ph", "astro-ph.CO"]}

Our numerical results differ moderately from previous computations in the literature, and lead to an absolute upper bound on the mixing angles of the dark matter sterile neutrino. Comparing this bound with existing astrophysical X-ray constraints, we find that the Dodelson-Widrow scenario, which proposes sterile neutrinos generated by active-sterile neutrino transitions to be the sole source of dark matter, is only possible for sterile neutrino masses lighter than 3.5 keV (6 keV if all hadronic uncertainties are pushed in one direction and the most stringent X-ray bounds are relaxed by a factor of two).

DM is negligible in the inner regions, which are dominated by stars and the central black hole. This prevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope of the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction decreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s accuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the virial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found in LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear inconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary nebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction within r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model by the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given radius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within r_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight (strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well modelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2 r/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for the isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly explain the low PN VDs, but not in full.

Ellipticals turn out to be inconsistent with cuspy low-concentration NFW models representing the total mass, nor are they consistent with a steeper -1.5 inner slope, nor with the shallower models proposed by Navarro et al. 04, nor with NFW models 10 times more concentrated than predicted, as deduced from several X-ray observations: the mass models, extrapolated inwards, lead to local mass-to-light ratios that are smaller than the stellar value inside an effective radius (R_e), and to central aperture velocity dispersions that are much smaller than observed. This conclusion remains true as long as there is no sharp steepening (slope < -2) of the dark matter (DM) DPs just inside 0.01 virial radii. The too low total mass and velocity dispersion produced within R_e by an NFW-like total mass profile suggests that the stellar component should dominate the DM one out to at least R_e. It should then be difficult to kinematically constrain the inner slope of the dark matter DP of ellipticals. The high concentration parameters deduced from X-ray observations appear to be a consequence of fitting an NFW model to the total mass DP made up of a stellar component that dominates inside and a DM component that dominates outwards. An appendix gives the virial mass dependence of the concentration parameter, central density, and total mass of the Navarro et al. model. In a 2nd appendix are given single integral expressions for the velocity dispersions averaged along the line-of-sight, in circular apertures and in thin slits, for general luminosity density and mass distributions, with isotropic orbits.", "published": "2004-05-24T15:23:12+00:00", "updated": "2014-12-11T22:49:52+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0405466v4", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09225.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09225.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405466v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0405466v4"], "journal_reference": "Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc. 362 (2005) 95-109; Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.\n  370 (2006) 1581-1584", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

There are two broad categories of measurements. The first uses individual astrophysical objects which have some property that allows their intrinsic luminosity or size to be determined, or allows the determination of their distance by geometric means. The second category comprises the use of all-sky cosmic microwave background, or correlations between large samples of galaxies, to determine information about the geometry of the Universe and hence the Hubble constant, typically in a combination with other cosmological parameters. Many, but not all, object-based measurements give $H_0$ values of around 72-74km/s/Mpc , with typical errors of 2-3km/s/Mpc. This is in mild discrepancy with CMB-based measurements, in particular those from the Planck satellite, which give values of 67-68km/s/Mpc and typical errors of 1-2km/s/Mpc. The size of the remaining systematics indicate that accuracy rather than precision is the remaining problem in a good determination of the Hubble constant.

The derivation requires only that the post-1-Newtonian vacuum field equations are satisfied in weak-field regions between the bodies; the bodies' internal gravity can be arbitrarily strong. The derivation extends previous results of Damour, Soffel and Xu (DSX) for weakly self-gravitating bodies for which the post-1-Newtonian field equations are satisfied everywhere. The derivation consists of a number of steps: (i) The definition of each body's current and mass multipole moments and center-of-mass worldline in terms of the behavior of the metric in a weak-field region surrounding the body. (ii) The definition for each body of a set of gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic tidal moments, again in terms of the behavior of the metric in a weak-field region surrounding the body. For the special case of weakly self-gravitating bodies, our definitions of these multipole and tidal moments agree with definitions given previously by DSX.

If the CMB temperature fluctuations were entirely produced at the last scattering, then the large-angle fluctuations would be much suppressed in comparison with the simply connected counterparts which is at variance with the observational data. However, as we shall show in this thesis, for low matter density models the observational constraints are less stringent since a large amount of large-angle fluctuations could be produced at late times. On the other hand, a slight suppression in large-angle temperature correlations in such models explains rather naturally the observed anomalously low quadrupole which is incompatible with the prediction of the \"standard\" Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-Lemaitre models. Interestingly, moreover, the development in the astronomical observation technology has made it possible to directly explore the imprint of the non-trivial topology by looking for identical objects so called \"ghosts\" in wide separated directions.

This represents a dramatic increase in significance from the original observations by the COBE-DMR and a marked increase in significance from the first-year WMAP maps.

Since Feigelson et al. (1995) and Kaneda et al. (1995) discovered the cosmic microwave background boosted inverse-Comptonized (IC) X-rays from the radio lobe, the magnetic field and electron energy density in the lobes have been estimated under the assumption that a single component of the relativistic electrons generates both the IC X-rays and the synchrotron radio emission. However, electrons generating the observed IC X-rays in the 1 -- 10 keV band do not possess sufficient energy to radiate the observed synchrotron radio emission under the estimated magnetic field of a few micro-G. On the basis of observations made with Suzaku, we show in the present paper that a 0.7 -- 20 keV spectrum is well described by a single power-law model with an energy index of 0.68 and a flux density of 0.12+/-0.01 micro-Jy at 1 keV from the West lobe. The derived multiwavelength spectrum strongly suggests that a single electron energy distribution over a Lorentz factor gamma = 300 - 90000 is responsible for generating both the X-ray and radio emissions.

Scoville"], "summary": "What is the role of the constants of nature in physical theory? I hypothesize that the observable universe, u0, constitutes a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) constrained by algorithmically random logical tape parameters defining its material properties (a physical UTM). The finite non-zero empirical values of Planck's constant, h, and other constants of nature exemplify those logical parameters. Their algorithmic randomness is necessary and sufficient for the consistent operation of a physical UTM. At any given time, ti, these constants correspond to the first n random halt digits, Omega-n, of Chaitin's Halting Probability, Omega. Planck's equation E=hv and Boltzmann's relation S=kLogW are shown to apply to the operation of a physical UTM. The genomic evolution of u0 in constants of nature space (CON space) from an undecidable state in u0's Planck era to its current ordered condition occurs through the algorithmically random, symmetry-breaking addition of new constants to the laws by which u0 operates -- a process called logical tunneling. The temperature of u0 for t<=tp is shown to be T=0K. The energy dissipated when a physical UTM clears its memory after each computation is proposed as a candidate for cold dark matter (CDM) and is calculated to comprise 87.5% of the cosmological matter content, Omega-M, of u0. This result concurs with current astronomical estimates that 87.1% of the matter content of u0 consists of CDM. The energy incorporated in u0 through the process of logical tunneling from undecidable states of the complete Universe, E, to decidable states of u0 is suggested as a candidate for the unexplained \"dark energy\", Omega-X, hypothesized to drive the accelerating cosmological expansion of space and believed to constitute 66% of the critical mass, Omega-0, of the observable universe.", "published": "2002-02-16T17:48:41+00:00", "updated": "2013-07-24T20:59:08+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0202314v4", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0202314v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0202314v4"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

It will be variable when the radial co-moving differential coordinate of FLRW is interpreted as physical and therefor transformable by a Lorentz transform locally to differentials of stationary physical coordinates. Because the FLRW differential radial distance has a time varying coefficient a(t), in the limit of a zero radial distance the light speed c(t) becomes time varying, proportional to the square root of the derivative of a(t) Since we assume homogeneity of space, this derived c(t) is the physical light speed for all events in the FLRW universe. This impacts the interpretation of astronomical observations of distant phenomena that are sensitive to light speed. A transform from FLRW is shown to have a physical radius out to all radial events in the visible universe. This shows a finite horizon beyond which there are no galaxies and no space. The general relativity (GR) field equation to determine a(t) and c(t) is maintained by using a variable gravitational constant and rest mass that keeps constant the gravitational and particle rest energies. This keeps constant the proportionality constant between the GR tensors of the field equation and conserves the stress-energy tensor of the ideal fluid used in the FLRW GR field equation.

Any well behaved transform is also a solution. The problem is relating the coordinates of the transform to observables. In the present case the objective is to find T,R on a stationary frame that has the R be a physical observable for all distances. We do this by working backwards, assuming the form of the metric that we desire, with some undetermined coefficients. These coefficients are then related to the partial derivatives of the transform. The transformed coordinates T,R are found by the integration of partial differential equations in the FLRW variables. We show that dR has the same units as the radial differential of the FLRW metric, which makes it observable. We develop a criterion for how close the transformed T comes to an observable time. Close to the space origin at the present time, T also becomes physical, so that the stationary acceleration becomes Newtonian. We show that a galactic point on a R,T plot starts close to the space origin at the beginning, moves out to a physical distance and finite time where it can release light that will be seen at the origin at the present time. Lastly, because the observable R has a finite limit at a finite T for t = 0 where the galactic velocity approaches the light speed, we see that the universe filled with an ideal fluid as seen on clocks and rulers on the stationary frame has a finite extent like that of an expanding empty universe, beyond which are no galaxies and no space.", "published": "2003-08-21T18:14:51+00:00", "updated": "2013-07-22T18:14:48+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0308379v8", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0308379v8", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0308379v8"], "journal_reference": "Abraham Zelmanov Journal, Vol.4:115-136, 2011", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

The GEM experiment uses a portable and double-shielded 5.5-m radiotelescope in altazimuthal configuration to map 60-degree-wide declination bands from different observational sites by circularly scanning the sky at zenithal angles of 30 deg from a constantly rotating platform. The observations were accomplished with a total power receiver, whose front-end High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) amplifier was matched directly to a cylindrical horn at the prime focus of the parabolic reflector.

Physically, the action of deflecting away gravitational attraction, which of course is directed toward the gravitation source, produces an equal but opposite reaction on the mechanism that produces the deflection of the gravitational action [the deflector], a reaction directed away from the gravitation source. The result is the combination of reducing the gravitational attractive acceleration of the object toward the gravitation source plus the introducing of a reactive acceleration on the object in the direction away from the gravitation source. Such a deflector, engineered to enable controlled adjustment of the amount and the direction of its action, could provide for a spacecraft both launch levitation and deep space travel acceleration.

Bekenstein"], "summary": "The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics states that the sum of changes in black hole entropy and the ordinary entropy of matter and fields outside the hole must be non-negative. In the classical limit, the GSL reduces to Hawking's area theorem. Neither law identifies the specific effects which makes it work in particular situations. Motivated by Davies' recent gedanken experiment he used to infer a bound on the size of the fine structure constant from the GSL, we study a series of variants in which an electric test charge is lowered to a finite radius and then dropped into a Schwarzschild, a near-extremal magnetic Reissner-Nordstrom or a near-extremal Kerr black hole. For a classical charge, we demonstrate that a specific \"backreaction\" effect is responsible for protecting the area theorem in the near-extremal examples. For the magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstrom hole an area theorem violation is defused by taking into account a subtle source of repulsion of the charge: the spinning up of the black hole in the process of bringing the charge down to its dropping point.

The simplest conceivable ansatz leads to a Stationary-Universe Model (SUM), which instead of the 'Steady-state Theory' is shown to be an arguable alternative to the Cosmological Concordance Model (CCM) commonly accepted today. The SUM stands out with redshift values statistically independent of time; a significant Hubble parameter is proved in contrast to the conventional one. It requires a negative gravitational 'dark' pressure of -1/3 the critical density. Intrinsic limitations of proper length and time are derived, which cause a struggle of local SRT (quantum mechanics) and universal GRT (gravitation). Using one macroscopic constant H in addition to c and G only, the model describes a background free of coincidences or horizon problems. While the CCM's key parameter Omega_Lambda seems determined by SUM 'boundary' conditions, there is a chance of having already observed parts of a stationary universe: With no need for 'dark energy', this alternative explains straightforwardly the SNe-Ia data on universal scales. In addition to its currently assumed parts, a non-lensing homogeneous background of matter might fill the gap to critical density. A mathematical solution for a perfect black-body spectrum composed of redshifted microwave radiation emitted from 'dark' sources within the universe is derived; thus the CMB might exist as a special part of the extragalactic background light.

The concept of solar activity is discussed along with an overview of the special indices used to quantify different aspects of variable solar activity, with special emphasis upon sunspot number. Over long timescales, quantitative information about past solar activity can only be obtained using a method based upon indirect proxies, such as the cosmogenic isotopes \\super{14}C and \\super{10}Be in natural stratified archives (e.g., tree rings or ice cores). We give an historical overview of the development of the proxy-based method for past solar-activity reconstruction over millennia, as well as a description of the modern state. Special attention is paid to the verification and cross-calibration of reconstructions. It is argued that this method of cosmogenic isotopes makes a solid basis for studies of solar variability in the past on a long timescale (centuries to millennia) during the Holocene. A separate section is devoted to reconstructions of strong solar energetic-particle (SEP) events in the past, that suggest that the present-day average SEP flux is broadly consistent with estimates on longer timescales, and that the occurrence of extra-strong events is unlikely.

We show that this same relationship can be obtained by using upper limit data or by randomizing the radio fluxes. In those cases, the relationship arises because one is effectively plotting distance vs distance in a flux-limited sample of objects. To correctly establish a relationship between L_R, L_X, and M_BH, one would need to analyze a volume-limited sample of objects. The distance effect can be removed from the sample, where a relationship between L_R/L_X and M_BH is found, showing that the L_R rises more quickly than L_X with increasing M_BH.

Goosmann"], "summary": "Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of AGNs can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the scattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.", "published": "2008-05-28T05:10:34+00:00", "updated": "2013-04-01T03:53:45+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4258v5", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/769/1/30", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/769/1/30", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.4258v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.4258v5"], "journal_reference": "The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 769, Issue 1, article id. 30\n  (2013)", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The nature of the inertial force is nothing but the real forces acting on the reference object. The essence of this reform of classical particle dynamics is just a drawback of traditional formalism in Newtonian mechanics being corrected.

Williams"], "summary": "We point out that the MacDonald formula for body-tide torques is valid only in the zeroth order of e/Q, while its time-average is valid in the first order. So the formula cannot be used for analysis in higher orders of e/Q. This necessitates corrections in the theory of tidal despinning and libration damping. We prove that when the inclination is low and phase lags are linear in frequency, the Kaula series is equivalent to a corrected version of the MacDonald method. The correction to MacDonald's approach would be to set the phase lag of the integral bulge proportional to the instantaneous frequency. The equivalence of descriptions gets violated by a nonlinear frequency-dependence of the lag. We explain that both the MacDonald- and Darwin-torque-based derivations of the popular formula for the tidal despinning rate are limited to low inclinations and to the phase lags being linear in frequency. The Darwin-torque-based derivation, though, is general enough to accommodate both a finite inclination and the actual rheology. Although rheologies with Q scaling as the frequency to a positive power make the torque diverge at a zero frequency, this reveals not the impossible nature of the rheology, but a flaw in mathematics, i.e., a common misassumption that damping merely provides lags to the terms of the Fourier series for the tidal potential. A hydrodynamical treatment (Darwin 1879) had demonstrated that the magnitudes of the terms, too, get changed. Reinstating of this detail tames the infinities and rehabilitates the \"impossible\" scaling law (which happens to be the actual law the terrestrial planets obey at low frequencies).", "published": "2008-03-23T00:47:17+00:00", "updated": "2012-08-26T01:39:49+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3299v8", "doi": "10.1007/s10569-009-9204-7", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10569-009-9204-7", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3299v8", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.3299v8"], "journal_reference": "Published in: Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy, Vol.\n  104, pp. 257 - 289 (2009)", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "physics.class-ph", "physics.geo-ph", "physics.hist-ph"]}

Nuclei propagating in the intergalactic space are photo-disintegrated and decrease their Lorentz factor due to the interaction with cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light. We calculate the evolution trajectories in the backward time, that describe how atomic mass number $A$ and Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$ change with redshift $z$. Three methods of spectra calculations are investigated and compared: {\\it (i)} trajectory method, {\\it(ii)} kinetic equation combined with trajectory calculations and {\\it (iii)} coupled kinetic equations. We believe that these three methods exhaust at least the principal possibilities for any analytic solution of the problem. In the most straightforward method {\\it(i)} only trajectory calculations are used to connect the observed nuclei flux with the production rate of primary (accelerated) nuclei $A_0$. In the second method {\\it (ii)} the flux (space density) of primary nuclei, and secondary nuclei and protons are calculated with the help of kinetic equation and trajectories are used only to determine the generation rates of these nuclei. The third method {\\it (iii)} consists in solving the complete set of coupled kinetic equations, written starting with primary nuclei $A_0$, then for $A_0-1$ etc down to the $A$ of interest. The solution of the preceding equation gives the generation rate for the one which follows. An important element of the calculations for all methods is the systematic use of Lorentz factor instead of energy.

Specifically, we study a five-dimensional model cosmology in type IIB supergravity, where the dual theory is an unstable deformation of $\\N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory on $\\Rbar\\times S^3$. A one-loop computation shows that the coupling governing the instability is asymptotically free, so quantum corrections cannot turn the potential around. The big crunch singularity in the bulk occurs when a boundary scalar field runs to infinity, in finite time. Consistent quantum evolution requires that we impose boundary conditions at infinite scalar field, i.e. a self-adjoint extension of the system. We find that quantum spreading of the homogeneous mode of the boundary scalar leads to a natural UV cutoff in particle production as the wavefunction for the homogeneous mode bounces back from infinity. However a perturbative calculation indicates that despite this, the logarithmic running of the boundary coupling governing the instability generally leads to significant particle production across the bounce. This prevents the wave packet of the homogeneous boundary scalar to return close to its initial form. Translating back to the bulk theory, we conclude that a quantum transition from a big crunch to a big bang is an improbable outcome of cosmological evolution in this class of five-dimensional models.", "published": "2007-12-27T02:43:00+00:00", "updated": "2012-07-05T08:08:00+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.4180v5", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043513", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043513", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4180v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.4180v5"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "hep-th", "categories": ["hep-th", "astro-ph"]}

The temperature and polarization fields are correlated, partial sky coverage correlates power spectrum estimators at different ell, and the likelihood function for a theory spectrum given a set of observed estimators is non-Gaussian. An accurate analysis must model all these properties. Most existing likelihood approximations are good enough for a temperature-only analysis, however they cannot reliably handle a temperature-polarization correlations. We give a new general approximation applicable for correlated Gaussian fields observed on part of the sky. The approximation models the non-Gaussian form exactly in the ideal full-sky limit and is fast to evaluate using a pre-computed covariance matrix and set of power spectrum estimators. We show with simulations that it is good enough to obtain correct results at ell >~ 30 where an exact calculation becomes impossible.

Shakhovskoy", "Masatoshi Shoji"], "summary": "Observations of the optical polarization of NGC 4151 in 1997-2003 show variations of an order of magnitude in the polarized flux while the polarization position angle remains constant. The amplitude of variability of the polarized flux is comparable to the amplitude of variability of the total U-band flux, except that the polarized flux follows the total flux with a lag of 8 +/- 3 days. The time lag and the constancy of the position angle strongly favor a scattering origin for the variable polarization rather than a non-thermal synchrotron origin. The orientation of the position angle of the polarized flux (parallel to the radio axis) and the size of the lag imply that the polarization arises from electron scattering in a flattened region within the low-ionization component of the broad-line-region. Polarization from dust scattering in the equatorial torus is ruled out as the source of the lag in polarized flux because it would produce a larger lag and, unless the half-opening angle of the torus is more than 53 degrees, the polarization would be perpendicular to the radio axis. We note a long-term change in the percentage of polarization at similar total flux levels and this could be due either to changing non-axisymmetry in the optical continuum emission, or a change in the number of scatterers on a timescale of years.", "published": "2007-11-07T07:02:49+00:00", "updated": "2012-02-24T07:13:49+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1019v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/148", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/148", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1019v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.1019v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Light curves are constructed, using a total of 1647 continuum level measurements. These results support the semidetached status of this interacting binary star. Radial velocities, residual intensities, full width half maxima (FWHM), line asymmetries, and equivalent widths of UV absorption lines for aluminum, magnesium, iron, and silicon in a range of ionization states are determined and analyzed. For selected epochs, we were able to isolate gas stream and photospheric contributions by an examination of the differences between spectral line shapes. We observed variations in line shape and strength, with orbital phase and epoch, indicating the presence of stable gas streams and circumstellar gas, and periods of increased mass-transfer activity associated with transient gas streams. The 1989 data indicates moderate activity. This epoch was examined most closely since it provides the greatest phase coverage. Spectral line profiles in 1978 and 1984 have the strongest gas-flow absorption components, indicating that these are the epochs of the greatest activity. The dense phase coverage in September 1989 allows us to measure the mass loss rate from Algol B into Algol A which is of order ~10E-14 solar masses per year. Since the highest gas-flow velocities are in the 100 kilometer per second range, well below escape velocity, we conclude that systemic mass loss due to gas flow is small for the Algol system.", "published": "2006-11-28T17:11:15+00:00", "updated": "2012-02-23T15:32:13+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611855v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611855v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0611855v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The reconstructed velocities of individual objects in 2MRS are well-correlated with the peculiar velocities obtained from high-precision observed distances within 3,000 km/s. We estimate the mean matter density to be 0.31 +/- 0.05 by comparing observed to reconstructed velocities in this volume. The reconstructed motion of the Local Group in the rest frame established by distances within 3,000 km/s agrees with the observed motion and is generated by fluctuations within this volume, in agreement with observations. Then, we reconstruct the velocity field of 2MRS in successively larger radii, to study the problem of convergence towards the CMB dipole. We find that less than half of the amplitude of the CMB dipole is generated within a volume enclosing the Hydra-Centaurus-Norma supercluster at around 40 Mpc/h. Although most of the amplitude of the CMB dipole seems to be recovered by 120 Mpc/h, the direction does not agree and hence we observe no convergence up to this scale. We develop a statistical model which allows us to estimate cosmological para meters from the reconstructed growth of convergence of the velocity of the Local Group towards the CMB dipole motion.

We analyze the relic abundance of the heavy photon, including its coannihilations with other T-odd particles, and map out the regions of the parameter space where it can account for the observed dark matter. We evaluate the prospects for direct and indirect discovery of the heavy photon dark matter.

Previously published searches, which are overwhelmingly at redshifts of z<1, exhibit a 42% detection rate (31 out of 73 sources), and the inclusion of our survey yields a 17% detection rate (2 out of 12 sources) at z>2.5. We therefore believe that our high redshift selection is responsible for our exclusive non-detections, and find that at ultra-violet luminosities of >10e23 W/Hz, 21-cm absorption has never been detected. We also find this to not only apply to our targets, but also those at low redshift exhibiting similar luminosities, giving zero detections out of a total of 16 sources over z=0.24 to 3.8. This is in contrast to the < 10e23 W/Hz sources where there is a near 50% detection rate of 21-cm absorption. The mix of 21-cm detections and non-detections is currently attributed to orientation effects, where according to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei, 21-cm absorption is more likely to occur in sources designated as radio galaxies (type-2 objects, where the nucleus is viewed through dense obscuring circumnuclear gas) than in quasars(type-1 objects, where we have a direct view to the nucleus). However, due to the exclusively high ultra-violet luminosities of our targets it is not clear whether orientation effects alone can wholly account for the distribution, although there exists the possibility that the large luminosities are indicative of a changing demographic of galaxy types.

The predictions can be tested by future numerical simulations and may be verified by upcoming observations.

Methods: We carried out detailed identifications of the observed absorption and emission features in the high resolution spectrum (4290 - 9015 A) of I22023 obtained with the Utrecht Echelle Spectrograph on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. Using Kurucz's WIDTH9 program and the spectrum synthesis code, SYNSPEC, we determined the atmospheric parameters and abundances. The photospheric abundances were derived under the LTE approximation. The NEBULAR package under IRAF was used to estimate the electron temperature (T_e) and the electron density (N_e) from the [N II] and [S II] lines. Results: We estimated T_eff=24000 K, log g=3.0, xi_t=7 kms^{-1}. The derived CNO abundances suggest an evolved star with C/O < 1. P-Cygni profiles of hydrogen and helium indicate ongoing post-AGB mass loss. The presence of [N II] and [S II] lines and the non-detection of [O III] indicate that photoionisation has just started. The derived nebular parameters T_e=7000 K, N_e=1.2X10^{4} cm^{-3} are comparable to those measured in young, compact planetary nebulae (PNe). The nebular expansion velocity was estimated to be 17.5 kms^{-1}. Conclusions: The observed spectral features, large heliocentric radial velocity (-148.31 +/- 0.60 kms^{-1}), atmospheric parameters and chemical composition indicate that I22023, at a distance of 1.95 kpc, is an evolved post-AGB star belonging to the old disk population.

We have shown that the overlap reduction function for the cross correlation between Virgo and the monopole mode of MiniGRAIL is very small, but a maximum was also found in the correlation at about 2710Hz, in the range of the MiniGRAIL sensitivity. In this paper the analysis is improved. After carefully reviewing the response function of interferometers to SGWs directly in the gauge of the local observer, the result is used to analyze the cross correlation between the two LIGO interferometers in their advanced configuration for a potential detection of relic SGWs and to release a lower bound for the integration time of such a detection. By using a new, frequency-dependent, overlap reduction function, a comparison with previous low-frequency approximations is therefore discussed. This is the first time that such a cross-correlation is computed in all the frequency spectrum of relic SGWs. The computation of a better signal to noise ratio is very important to understand if a scalar component of GWs is present at high frequency. With the new overlap reduction function, an order of magnitude is gained concerning the integration time for detecting the relic SGWs' signal.

The range of partition- ing of specific angular momentum in these systems is found to be large, spanning several orders of magnitude. The analysis shows that multi-planet systems tend to have the highest values of specific angular momentum normalized against the planetary masses. This suggests that in high angular momentum systems, the dominant contributors have already been discovered, and that single-planet sys- tems with low observed angular momentum may be the most likely candidates for additional undiscovered companions compared to their high angular momentum, single-planet counterparts.

These observations were triggered using the VLT Rapid Response Mode (RRM), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena, without any human intervention. This resulted in the first UVES exposure of GRB060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial Swift satellite trigger. A sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25, 41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7 km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. This time-series clearly shows evidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving FeII fine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both FeII and NiII, at the host-galaxy redshift z=1.490. This is the first report of absorption lines arising from metastable levels of FeII and NiII along any GRB sightline. We model the observed evolution of the level populations with three different excitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, and fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. Our data allow us to reject the collisional and IR excitation scenarios with high confidence. The UV pumping model, in which the GRB afterglow UV photons excite a cloud of atoms with a column density N, distance d, and Doppler broadening parameter b, provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log N(FeII)=14.75+0.06-0.04, log N(NiII)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see Appendix A), and b=25+/-3 km/s. The success of our UV pumping modeling implies that no significant amount of FeII or NiII is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratum in Appendix A), most likely because it is ionized by the GRB X-ray/UV flash. Because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than FeII and NiII, this minimum distance also applies to any HI present.

Hughes"], "summary": "The coalescence of massive black holes is one of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for LISA. Measurements of the GWs can localize the source on the sky to an ellipse with a major axis of a few tens of arcminutes to a few degrees, depending on source redshift, and a minor axis which is 2--4 times smaller. The distance (and thus an approximate redshift) can be determined to better than a per cent for the closest sources we consider, although weak lensing degrades this performance. It will be of great interest to search this three-dimensional `pixel' for an electromagnetic counterpart to the GW event. The presence of a counterpart allows unique studies which combine electromagnetic and GW information, especially if the counterpart is found prior to final merger of the holes. To understand the feasibility of early counterpart detection, we calculate the evolution of the GW pixel with time. We find that the greatest improvement in pixel size occurs in the final day before merger, when spin precession effects are maximal. The source can be localized to within 10 square degrees as early as a month before merger at $z = 1$; for higher redshifts, this accuracy is only possible in the last few days.", "published": "2008-10-28T20:08:10+00:00", "updated": "2011-08-03T02:22:53+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.5125v2", "doi": "10.1088/0264-9381/26/9/094035", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/26/9/094035", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5125v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.5125v2"], "journal_reference": "Class.Quant.Grav.26:094035,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

Some theoretical estimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium abundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The intracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a significant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray derived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass fraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out that cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and X-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to measure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For example, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by Bonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a primordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of 1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that interesting accuracy is within reach.

The strongest effect (with a significance level of 10^{-6}) is the difference between the brightness distributions of simple bursts (dominated by a single smooth pulse) and complex bursts (consisting of overlapping pulses). The latter has a break at a peak flux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth down to the BATSE threshold. We also observe brightness dependent variations in the shape of the average peak aligned time profile (ATP) of GRBs. The decaying slope of the ATP shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts while the rising slope hardly changes. Both slopes of the ATP are deformed for weak bursts as compared to strong bursts. The interpretation of these effects is simple: a complex burst where a number of independent pulses overlap in time appears intrinsically stronger than a simple burst. Then the BATSE sample of complex bursts covers larger redshifts where some cosmological factor causes the break in the peak brightness distribution.

The created antineutrinos (neutrinos) should be violently ejected outside the horizon of a black hole composed from matter (antimatter). Our rudimentary calculations suggest that both, the supermassive black hole in the centre of our Galaxy and in the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy may produce a flux of antineutrinos measurable with the new generation of one cubic kilometre neutrino telescopes.

We identify parameter values for which in the absence of back-reaction the induced curvature fluctuations are larger than the primordial adiabatic ones. In the specific model we study, however, back-reaction limits the growth of the entropy fluctuations. We discuss situations in which back-reaction effects are less constraining.

Fast Fourier transforms are then used to compute Fourier coefficients, which are related to spherical harmonic coefficients through a linear transform. By recasting the problem as a Fourier transform on the torus we appeal to the usual Shannon sampling theorem to develop spherical harmonic transforms that are theoretically exact for band-limited functions, thereby providing an alternative sampling theorem on the sphere. The computational complexity of our forward and inverse spin spherical harmonic transforms scale as O(L^3) for any arbitrary spin number, where L is the harmonic band-limit of the spin function on the sphere. Numerical experiments are performed and unfortunately the forward transform is found to be unstable for band-limits above L~32.

The determined periods are assumed to be related to rotation periods of the investigated stars. Among them 10 new variables with periods longer than 10 days were found, which brings the total number of slowly rotating M stars with known rotation periods to 12 objects. X-ray activity and rotation evolution of M stars follows the trends observed in G-K type stars. Rapidly rotating stars are very active and activity decreases with increasing rotation period but the period-activity relation is mass-dependent which suggests that the rotation period alone is not a proper measure of activity. The investigated stars were grouped according to their mass and the empirical turnover time was determined for each group. It increases with decreasing mass more steeply than for K type stars for which a flat dependence had been found. The resulting Rossby number-activity relation shows an exponential decrease of activity with increasing Rossby number. The analysis of space motions of 27 single stars showed that all rapidly rotating and a few slowly rotating stars belong to young disk (YD) whereas all old disk (OD) stars are slowly rotating. The median rotation period of YD stars is about 2 days and that of OD stars is equal to 47 days, i.e. nearly 25 times longer. The average X-ray flux of OD stars is about 1.7 dex lower than YD stars in a good agreement with the derived Rossby number-activity formula supplemented with rotation-age relation and in a fair agreement with recent observations but in a disagreement with the Skumanich formula supplemented with the activity-rotation relation.", "published": "2007-07-17T10:24:08+00:00", "updated": "2011-05-13T07:28:41+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.2577v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2577v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.2577v2"], "journal_reference": "Acta Astron.57:149-172,2007", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Methods: iCosmo is a software package to perform interactive cosmological calculations for the low redshift universe. Computing distance measures, the matter power spectrum, and the growth factor is supported for any values of the cosmological parameters. It also computes derived observed quantities for several cosmological probes such as cosmic shear, baryon acoustic oscillations and type Ia supernovae. The associated errors for these observables can be derived for customised surveys, or for pre-set values corresponding to current or planned instruments. The code also allows for the calculation of cosmological forecasts with Fisher matrices which can be manipulated to combine different surveys and cosmological probes. The code is written in the IDL language and thus benefits from the convenient interactive features and scientific library available in this language. iCosmo can also be used as an engine to perform cosmological calculations in batch mode, and forms a convenient adaptive platform for the development of further cosmological modules. With its extensive documentation, it may also serve as a useful resource for teaching and for newcomers in the field of cosmology. Results: The iCosmo package is described with various examples and command sequences. The code is freely available with documentation at http://www.icosmo.org, along with an interactive web interface and is part of the Initiative for Cosmology, a common archive for cosmological resources.", "published": "2008-10-08T19:45:01+00:00", "updated": "2011-04-28T15:08:11+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1285v2", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200811112", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200811112", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1285v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1285v2"], "journal_reference": "2011A&A...528A..33R", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Several molecular transitions were observed between 1.6 and 3 mm to constrain the physical parameters of the molecular cloud interacting with the SNR and to investigate the effects of the SNR shock on the gas chemistry. We detected shock-excited near-infrared H2 emission towards the centre of the SNR, revealing highly clumped molecular gas and a good correlation with published mid-infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope. An excellent correlation between the H2 clumps and OH(1720 MHz) maser positions supports the shock excitation of the OH(1720 MHz) maser emission. Furthermore, we detected OH absorption at 1665 and 1667 MHz which shows a good correlation with the shocked H2 emission and the masers.

We measured the infrared absorption spectra of amorphous and crystalline water ice in the 10-50 K and 10-140 K temperature range, respectively, and conducted a systematic experimental study to investigate the amorphization of crystalline water ice via ionizing radiation irradiation at doses of up to 160 \\pm 30 eV per molecule. We found that crystalline water ice can be converted only partially to amorphous ice by electron irradiation. The experiments showed that a fraction of the 1.65 \\mum band, which is characteristic for crystalline water ice, survived the irradiation, to a degree that strongly depends on the temperature. Quantitative kinetic fits of the temporal evolution of the 1.65 \\mum band clearly demonstrate that there is a balance between thermal recrystallization and irradiation-induced amorphization, with thermal recrystallizaton dominant at higher temperatures. Our experiments show the amorphization at 40K was incomplete, in contradiction to Mastrapa and Brown's conclusion (Icarus 2006, 183, 207.). At 50 K, the recrystallization due to thermal effects is strong, and most of the crystalline ice survived.

Non-Gaussianities offer many distinguish features. As usual with a small sound speed, non-Gaussianity can be relatively large, around current sensitivity levels. For DBI-like lagrangians, the amplitude is negative in the inflationary branch, and can be either negative or positive in the ekpyrotic branch. Unlike the power spectrum, the three-point amplitude displays a large tilt that, in the expanding case, peaks on smallest scales. While the shape is predominantly of the equilateral type in the inflationary branch, as in DBI inflation, it is of the local form in the ekpyrotic branch.

This can show up as observational signatures in the power spectrum and/or non-Gaussianities of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). One general example of such sharp features is a succession of small steps in a warped throat, caused by Seiberg duality cascade using gauge/gravity duality. We study the cosmological observational consequences of these steps in brane inflation. Since the steps come in a series, the prediction of other steps and their properties can be tested by future data and analysis. It is also possible that the steps are too close to be resolved in the power spectrum, in which case they may show up only in the non-Gaussianity of the CMB temperature fluctuations and/or EE polarization. We study two cases. In the slow-roll scenario where steps appear in the inflaton potential, the sensitivity of brane inflation to the height and width of the steps is increased by several orders of magnitude comparing to that in previously studied large field models. In the IR DBI scenario where steps appear in the warp factor, we find that the glitches in the power spectrum caused by these sharp features are generally small or even unobservable, but associated distinctive non-Gaussianity can be large. Together with its large negative running of the power spectrum index, this scenario clearly illustrates how rich and different a brane inflationary scenario can be when compared to generic slow-roll inflation.

The most well-known method for dealing with comparisons like that is the $\\chi^2$ approach. In this paper we consider the restrictions imposed by this approach and present an alternative way for making model comparisons using Bayesian statistics. In order to quantify our beliefs we use Bayes factors and information criteria such as AIC and BIC. Three simulated datasets are analyzed in order to validate the procedure and assess the effects of varying error bar size. Another two datasets (Ugarte-Urra et al., 2005; Priest et al., 2000) are re-analyzed using the method described above. In one of these two datasets (Ugarte-Urra et al., 2005), due to the error estimates in the observed temperature values, it is not posible to distinguish between the different heating mechanisms. For this we suggest that both Classical and Bayesian statistics should be applied in order to make safe assumptions about the nature of the coronal heating mechanisms.", "published": "2008-07-28T13:56:02+00:00", "updated": "2011-02-01T18:17:22+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4209v2", "doi": "10.1007/s11207-009-9498-3", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11207-009-9498-3", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4209v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4209v2"], "journal_reference": "Solar Phys.262:117-134,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "astro-ph.SR"]}

Miedema"], "summary": "It is shown that a first-order cosmological perturbation theory for Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universes admits one and only one gauge-invariant variable which describes the perturbation to the energy density and which becomes equal to the usual energy density of the Newtonian theory of gravity in the limit that all particle velocities are negligible with respect to the speed of light. The same holds true for the perturbation to the particle number density. A cosmological perturbation theory based on these particular gauge-invariant quantities is more precise than any earlier first-order perturbation theory. In particular, it explains star formation in a satisfactory way, even in the absence of cold dark matter. In a baryon-only universe, the earliest stars, the so-called Population III stars, are found to have masses between 400 and 100,000 solar masses with a peak around 3400 solar masses. If cold dark matter, with particle mass 10 times heavier than the proton mass, is present then the star masses are between 16 and 4000 solar masses with a peak around 140 solar masses. They come into existence between 100 Myr and 1000 Myr. At much later times, star formation is possible only in high density regions, for example within galaxies. Late time stars may have much smaller masses than early stars. The smallest stars that can be formed have masses of 0.2--0.8 solar mass, depending on the initial internal relative pressure perturbation. It is demonstrated that the Newtonian theory of gravity cannot be used to study the evolution of cosmological density perturbations.", "published": "2008-05-04T14:44:00+00:00", "updated": "2011-01-29T21:14:30+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0421v5", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0421v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.0421v5"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "gr-qc", "categories": ["gr-qc", "astro-ph"]}

We have examined the properties of the CS in some detail in order to assess its cosmological significance. We have performed a cluster analysis of the local extrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a large group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have re-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps, which have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the signal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar properties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of the CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian tail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we apply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in two parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the filter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the filter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the smoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between initial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is formed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles between 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This signal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in both the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After subtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity.", "published": "2007-12-07T11:41:24+00:00", "updated": "2011-01-29T10:37:10+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1118v2", "doi": "10.1134/S199034131002001X", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S199034131002001X", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1118v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1118v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.

(arXive:astro-ph:/1011.4035, 2010) the authors addressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of high-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of energy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet (CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are formed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence processes. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly fragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective energy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether this mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation by deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The results of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a specific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded in the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of energetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission regions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of diffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and dynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the results of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of ribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled bright kernels.

As the energy loss mechanisms of such particles is of great interest, one must improve in some sense the previously intuitive description of classical sources in the presence of fields. In this brief note we evaluate the role played by the classical and dimensional proper acceleration of a particle in radiation processes. One intends to show that the introduction of the acceleration as a measure parameter gives an adequate scale for considering the processes of massive particle emission. If the acceleration threshold is not attained one is considering a regime where the processes of massive particle production are suppressed. The analysis is performed in a semiclassical formalism once applied in different contexts and already checked for consistency in a serie of papers. As a further application of the results we evaluate the possibility of a non negligible meson production by protons accelerated in the framework of polar cap models operating in electromagnetic fields of pulsars.

However, the density of the first-generation particles produced by curvature photons in the magnetospheres of magnetars can exceed the density of the same particles in the magnetospheres of ordinary radio pulsars.

The velocity dispersion map shows a weak gradient increasing towards a central (R<1\") value of sigma_0=170+/-9 km/s. We deproject the observed surface brightness from HST imaging to obtain a realistic luminosity density of the lens galaxy, which in turn is used to build axisymmetric dynamical models that fit the observed kinematic maps. We also construct a gravitational lens model that accurately fits the positions and relative fluxes of the four quasar images. We find that the resulting luminous and total mass distribution are nearly identical around the Einstein radius R_E = 0.89\", with a slope that is close to isothermal, but which becomes shallower towards the center if indeed mass follows light. The dynamical model fits to the observed kinematic maps result in a total mass-to-light ratio (M/L)_dyn=3.7+/-0.5 M_sun/L_sun,I (in the I-band). This is consistent with the Einstein mass M_E = 1.54 x 10^10 M_sun divided by the (projected) luminosity within R_E, which yields a total mass-to-light ratio of (M/L)_E=3.4 M_sun/L_sun,I, with an error of at most a few per cent.

Other approaches for estimates of the velocities were also used. All these estimates are in accordance with the same exponential decrease in velocity. The estimates of time variations in the relative amount of ejected particles were based also on results of the analysis of time variations in the size of the bright region of ejected material. At te~10 s, the morphology of the ejecta (e.g. the location and brightness of the brightest pixel) changed and the rate rte of ejection of observed material increased. Between 1 and 3 seconds after the impact and between 8 and 60 seconds after the impact, more small bright particles were ejected than expected from crater excavation alone. An outburst triggered by the impact could cause such a difference. The sharp (by a factor of 1.6) decrease in the rate of ejection at 55<te<72 s could be caused by a decrease in the outburst that began at 10 s. Analysis of observations of the DI cloud and of the outbursts from some comets testifies in favour of the proposition that there can be large cavities, with material under gas pressure, below a considerable fraction of a comet's surface. Internal gas pressure and material in the cavities can produce natural and triggered outbursts and can cause splitting of comets.", "published": "2008-10-07T20:35:10+00:00", "updated": "2010-11-25T00:25:23+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1294v4", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1294v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1294v4"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Generally the high rate of star formation in a complex is accompanied by the high number of bound clusters, including massive ones, what was explained by the high gas pressure in such regions. However, there are also complexes, where clusters seems to be more numerous in relation to stars than in a common complex. The high rate of clusters - but not isolated stars - formation seems to be typical for many isolated bursts of star formation, but deficit of stars might be still explained by the observational selection. The latter cannot, however, explain the complexes or the dwarf galaxies, where the high formation rate of only stars is observed. The possibility of the very fast dissolution of parental clusters just in such regions should itself be explained.

One such difficulty is the cusp/core problem. High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark matter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark matter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body structure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at the center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar feedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However, strong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic halos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of the rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo mass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational results for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS). The lensing probabilities based on such density profiles are too low to match the observed lensing in CLASS/JVAS. High baryon densities in the galaxies that dominate the lensing statistics can reconcile this discrepancy, but only if they steepen the mass profile rather than making it more shallow. This places contradictory demands upon the effects of baryons on the central mass profiles of galaxies.", "published": "2008-08-02T04:23:45+00:00", "updated": "2010-11-18T15:55:18+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0225v3", "doi": "10.1088/1674-4527/10/12/003", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-4527/10/12/003", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0225v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0225v3"], "journal_reference": "Res.Astron.Astrophys.10:1215-1222,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We find that infalling bodies always stall at the edge of these newly formed cores, experiencing no dynamical friction over many dynamical times. As applications, we consider the resulting decrease in the dark matter annihilation flux due to centrally destroyed cusps, and we present a new theory for the formation of close binary nuclei -- the `stalled binary' model. We focus on one particularly interesting binary nucleus system, the dwarf spheroidal galaxy VCC 128 which is dark matter dominated at all radii. We show that its nuclei would rapidly coalesce within a few million years if it has a central dark matter cusp slope steeper than r^{-1}.

Since our previous review the lower limit on the photon Compton wavelength has improved by four orders of magnitude, to about one astronomical unit, and rapid current progress in astronomy makes further advance likely. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. Meanwhile there are striking observations of astronomical motions that do not fit Einstein gravity with visible sources. \"Cold dark matter\" (slow, invisible classical particles) fits well at large scales. \"Modified Newtonian dynamics\" provides the best phenomenology at galactic scales. Satisfying this phenomenology is a requirement if dark matter, perhaps as invisible classical fields, could be correct here too. \"Dark energy\" {\\it might} be explained by a graviton-mass-like effect, with associated Compton wavelength comparable to the radius of the visible universe.

While spurious host galaxy detections will, therefore, be rare, the possibility must be considered when examining individual GRB/host galaxy examples. It is also tempting to use the large and uniform collection of X-ray afterglow positions to search for GRB-associated galaxies.

We investigate two simple scenarios for explaining the observed Ly-a and rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) of LAEs: (i) the \"escape fraction\" scenario, in which the \"effective\" escape fraction (including the IGM attenuation) of Ly-a photons is f_Lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the \"stochastic\" scenario, in which the fraction of LAEs that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \\Cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) after correcting for the IGM attenuation. Our comparisons with a number of different observations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escape fraction scenario. We find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicity and black hole mass hosted by LAEs are all smaller in the stochastic scenario than in the escape fraction scenario. In our simulations, the galaxy stellar mass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation. However, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in the specific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frame UV LF from z=6 to 3. The rest-frame UV LF of both LAEs and LBGs at z=3 & 6 can be described well by the stochastic scenario provided the extinction is moderate, E(B-V) ~0.15, for both populations, although our simulation might be overpredicting the number of bright LBGs at z=6. We also discuss the correlation function and bias of LAEs. The Ly-a LFs at z=6 in a field-of-view of 0.2 deg^2 show a significantly larger scatter owing to cosmic variance relative to that in a 1 deg^2 field, and the scatter seen in the current observational estimates of the Ly-a LF can be accounted for by cosmic variance.", "published": "2008-02-02T00:33:32+00:00", "updated": "2010-09-28T17:57:30+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.0228v2", "doi": "10.1093/pasj/62.6.1455", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pasj/62.6.1455", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.0228v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.0228v2"], "journal_reference": "2010, PASJ, 62, 1455", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The conclusions depend only weakly on the details of the de Broglie-Bohm dynamics. We discuss, in particular, the nonequilibrium breaking of scale invariance for the primordial (scalar) power spectrum.

Hirata", "Uros Seljak"], "summary": "Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the GI correlation term can exceed the usual II term by >1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude.

Firstly, the universe is rational and the rationality is the proportional density distribution in any independent galaxy. Proportion means that the density distribution of stars is orderly. For example, there are four giants standing in array. Their heights are A, B, C, D, respectively, and A, B stand in the first row from left to right, C, D in the second row from left to right. Proportion requires that A divided by C be equal to B divided by D. Rational structures are smooth 2- (or 3-) dimensional structures, which are either circularly (spherically) symmetric with respect to the center point, or bilaterally symmetric. Secondly, spiral galaxy arms are linearly shaped, which are neither circularly symmetric nor bilaterally symmetric. Therefore, arms are not rational structures. Arm patterns exist only in spiral galaxies and they are weak compared with the main disk structure. Therefore, the presence of arm structure is the disturbance to the rational structure. Because arm patterns exist only in spiral galaxies and only spiral galaxies present dust, I come to the critical answer to the above question: any disturbance to rational structure produces cosmic dust. From now on we call the disturbance to rational structure the cosmic impulse.

The number density of [OII] emitting galaxies above this luminosity declines by a factor of >~2.5 between z ~ 1.35 and z ~ 0.84. In the limit of no number-density evolution, the characteristic [OII] luminosity, L^*_[OII], defined as the luminosity where the space density equals 10^{-3.5} dex^{-1} Mpc^{-3}, declines by a factor of ~1.8 over the same redshift interval. Assuming that L_[OII] is proportional to the star-formation rate (SFR), and negligible change in the typical dust attenuation in galaxies at fixed [OII] luminosity, the measured decline in L^*_[OII] implies a ~25% per Gyr decrease in the amount of star formation in galaxies during this epoch. Adopting a faint-end power-law slope of -1.3\\pm0.2, we derive the comoving SFR density in four redshift bins centered around z~1 by integrating the observed [OII] luminosity function using a local, empirical calibration between L_[OII] and SFR, which statistically accounts for variations in dust attenuation and metallicity among galaxies.

We confirm the finding by Gao et al. that at fixed mass, the clustering of halos depends on the halo formation time, especially for low-mass halos. This age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study the correlation between the occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age. We find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has a strong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. The youngest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellites than the oldest one-third. For central galaxies, in halos that form earlier, they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and the dependence of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellar mass. The results can be understood through the star formation history in halos and the merging of satellites onto central galaxies.

A narrow filament-like structure was observed extending south-east from the central proto-binary system towards TMR-1C, suggesting a morphology in which the candidate protoplanet may have been ejected from the TMR-1 system. Follow-up low-resolution spectroscopy by Terebey et al. 2000, however, could not confirm if this object is a protoplanet or a low-luminosity background star. We present two epochs of near-infrared photometric observations obtained at the CFHT of TMR-1C. The time span of ~7 years between the two sets of observations provides with an opportunity to, (a) check for any photometric variability similar to that observed among young stellar objects, which would indicate the youth of this source, and, (b) determine the proper motion. TMR-1C displays large photometric variability between 1 and 2 mag in both the H- and Ks-bands. From our 2002 observations, we find a (H-Ks) color of 0.3 mag, which is much bluer than the value of 1.3 mag reported by T98 from HST observations. Also, we observe brightening in both the H- and Ks-bands when the colors are bluer, i.e. the object gets redder as it becomes fainter.

One possibility is that a trispectrum will be observed without evidence for a non-zero bispectrum. It is not difficult for this to occur in inflationary models where quantum fluctuations in a field other than the inflaton contribute to the density perturbations. A natural question to ask is whether such an observation would rule out the standard scenarios.

In this paper we explore the effect of this model in both the early universe and in the galaxy.", "published": "2008-10-29T17:35:10+00:00", "updated": "2010-07-26T15:32:39+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.5167v3", "doi": "10.1007/JHEP10(2010)066", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/JHEP10(2010)066", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5167v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.5167v3"], "journal_reference": "JHEP 1010:066,2010", "primary_category": "hep-ph", "categories": ["hep-ph", "astro-ph"]}

Their Nature and the completeness of the Hickson sample", "authors": ["Eugenia Diaz-Gimenez", "Gary Mamon"], "summary": "We identify compact groups of galaxies (CGs) within mock galaxy catalogues from the Millennium Simulation at z=0 with three semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. CGs are identified using the same 2D criteria as those visually applied by Hickson (1982) to his CGs (HCGs), but with a brightest galaxy magnitude limit, and the blending of close projected pairs. Half of the mock CGs identified in projection contain at least 4 accordant velocities (mvCGs), versus 70% for HCGs. In comparison to mvCGs, the HCGs are only 8% complete at distances < 9000 km/s, missing the CGs with small angular sizes, a strongly dominant galaxy, and (for one SAM) the CGs that are fainter and those with lower surface brightness. We explore different ways to determine the fraction of physically dense groups. Binding energy criteria turn out to be inapplicable given the segregation between galaxies and dark matter particles. We rely instead on the combination of the 3D length of the CGs (maximum real space galaxy separation) and their elongation along the line-of-sight (ratio of maximum line-of-sight to maximum projected separations), restricting ourselves in both cases to smallest quartets within the CGs. We find that between 64% and 80% (depending on the SAM) of the mvCGs have 3D lengths shorter than 200 kpc/h, between 71% and 80% have line-of-sight elongations less than 2, while between 59% and 76% have either 3D lengths shorter than 100 kpc/h or both lengths shorter than 200 kpc/h and elongations smaller than 2. Therefore, chance alignments (CAs) of galaxies concern at most 40% of the mvCGs. These CAs are mostly produced from larger host groups, but a few have galaxies extending a few Mpc beyond the host group. The mvCGs built with the Hickson selection with (without) the close projected pair blending criterion have 10% higher (lower) fractions of physically dense systems.", "published": "2008-09-22T15:51:38+00:00", "updated": "2010-07-22T17:05:41+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3483v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17394.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17394.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3483v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3483v2"], "journal_reference": "Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.409:1227-1243,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

One hundred thirty-eight periodic variables were discovered, of which five are eclipsing binary candidates with unequal minima. The remaining 133 periodic variables appear to consist mainly of late-type stars whose variation is due to rotation modulated by star spot activity.

Methods: We present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for a GRB afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. The data set contains 412 data points in total to which we add additional data from the literature. Furthermore, we present low-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. The afterglow light curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power law fits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections. The absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive column densities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis from which we derive the metallicity of the host of GRB 060526. Results: The temporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law with breaks at $t=0.090\\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\\pm0.061$ days. It shows deviations from the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energy injections from the central engine, although some significant microvariability remains. The broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows no significant extinction along the line of sight. The metallicity derived from \\ion{S}{II} and \\ion{Fe}{II} of [S/H] = --0.57 $\\pm$0.25 and [Fe/H] = --1.09$\\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparable to the metallicity of other GRB hosts at similar redshifts.

By combining the Gauss-Codacci and Lanczos equations, we write down explicitly the general gravitational field equations on each of the two branes, while using distribution theory we express the matter field equations on the branes in terms of the discontinuities of the first derivatives of the matter fields. Afterwards, we address three important issues: (i) the hierarchy problem; (ii) the radion mass; and (iii) the localization of gravity, the 4-dimensional Newtonian effective potential and the Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. With a very conservative estimation, we find that the radion mass is of the order of $10^{-2} GeV$. The gravity is localized on the visible brane, and the spectrum of the gravitational KK modes is discrete and can be of the order of TeV.

In this context, SN2008D associated with XT080109 could represent a paradigmatic case, since it might exemplify a potential borderline event. The main aim is to infer geometric information of SN2008D through the evolution of its linear optical polarization. We also report the polarization evolution of SN2007uy, and discuss the properties of the host ISM towards the XT. The final goal is to compare the polarization properties, and hence the geometries of both SNe, which shone contemporaneously in NGC2770. This fortunate coincidence brought us the opportunity to observe both SNe simultaneously, and most importantly, with identical instrumental setups. The observations span 74.9 days, starting 3.6 days after the XT and are distributed in 11 visits. In addition we performed observations in the mm range in order to identify the dominant polarization. We report positive linear polarization detections at several epochs for SN2008D at a level of ~1% and at ~1.5% for SN2007uy. SN2007uy shows constant polarization, which could be described by the host interstellar polarization plus a constant eccentricity expansion on the sky plane. A statistical analysis of the distribution of the SN2008D Stokes parametres suggests that it could show an intrinsic variable polarization component. Assuming the SN2007uy polarization is constant, we find that the evolution of the intrinsic SN2008D polarization could be explained by an aspherical axisymmetric expansion with variable eccentricity.

It has been suggested that the central soft X-ray and EUV excess found in some clusters cannot be of thermal origin, due to problems with rapid gas cooling and the persistent non-detection of the O VII line, but may arise from inverse-Compton scattering between intracluster relativistic electrons and the cosmic microwave background. In fact, recent XMM observations of the soft X-rays from Coma and Abell 3112 are equally well fitted by a power law or a thermal virialized gas. Therefore the missing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux could partly be due to an overestimate of the central density of virialized electrons which scatter the CMB. Synchrotron radiation in an intracluster magnetic field of strength of a few $\\mu$G is responsible for significant additional electron energy loss. Equipartition between relativistic particle and magnetic field energy densities is a realistic possibility. GHz radiation data from a Coma cluster halo yields information on the high energy steepening of the cluster relativistic electron spectrum. Cluster microwave emission in the WMAP passbands by higher energy cosmic ray electrons and gamma ray emission from an accompanying cosmic ray proton flux are also considered.

The detailed diagnostics of accretion disc structure can be achieved by including in its description all the relevant heating and cooling physical mechanism, in particular the convective energy transport that, although dominant at temperatures less than about 10 000 K, is usually not taken into account when calculating spectra of accretion discs. We constructed a radiative transfer code coupled with a code determining the disc's hydrostatic vertical structure. We have obtained for the first time model spectra of cold, convective accretion discs. As expected, these spectra are mostly flat in the optical wavelengths with no contribution from the UV, which in quiescence must be emitted by the white dwarf. The disc structures obtained with our radiative-transfer code compare well with the solutions of equations used to describe the dwarf-nova outburst cycle according to the thermal-viscous disc instability model thus allowing the two to be combined. Our code allows calculating the spectral evolution of dwarf nova stars through their whole outburst cycle, providing a new tool for testing models of accretion discs in cataclysmic variables. We show that convection plays an important role in determining the vertical disc structure and substantially affects emitted spectra when, as often the case, it is effective at optical depths tau ~ 1.

The chief purpose of this paper is to present a clear exposition of the physical cause and consequence of inflation in spherical, charged black holes. Inflation acts like a particle accelerator in that it accelerates cold ingoing and outgoing streams through each other to prodigiously high energies. Inflation feeds on itself: the acceleration is powered by the gravity produced by the streaming energy. The paper: (1) uses physical arguments to develop simple approximations that follow the evolution of inflation from ignition, through inflation itself, to collapse; (2) confirms that the simple approximations capture accurately the results of fully nonlinear one- and two-fluid self-similar models; (3) demonstrates that, counter-intuitively, the smaller the accretion rate, the more rapidly inflation exponentiates; (4) shows that in single perfect-fluid models, inflation occurs only if the sound speed equals the speed of light, supporting the physical idea that inflation in single fluids is driven by relativistic counter-streaming of waves; (5) shows that what happens during inflation up to the Planck curvature depends not on the distant past or future, but rather on events happening only a few hundred black hole crossing times into the past or future; (6) shows that, if quantum gravity does not intervene, then the generic end result of inflation is not a general relativistic null singularity, but rather a spacelike singularity at zero radius.", "published": "2008-11-12T16:00:57+00:00", "updated": "2010-06-15T17:36:50+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1926v4", "doi": "10.1016/j.physrep.2010.06.002", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2010.06.002", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1926v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1926v4"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rept.495:1-32, 2010", "primary_category": "gr-qc", "categories": ["gr-qc", "astro-ph", "hep-th"]}

Accounting for random interlopers mimicking an OVI doublet, we derive for the first time a secure lower limit for the redshift number density $\\Delta N / \\Delta z$ for redshifts z_abs>2.8. With extensive Monte Carlo simulations we quantify the losses of absorbers due to blending with the ubiquitous Lyman forest lines, and estimate the success rate of retrieving each individual candidate as a function of its redshift, the emission redshift of the quasar, the strength of the absorber and the measured S/N of the spectrum by modelling typical Ly forest spectra. These correction factors allow us to derive the 'incompleteness and S/N corrected' redshift number densities of OVI absorbers :$\\Delta N _{OVI, c} / \\Delta z_{c} (2.8 < z < 3.2) = 4.6+-0.3, at 3.2 < z < 3.6 = 6.7+-0.8,and at 3.6 < z < 4.0 = 8.4+-2.9.

Using a two-dimensional galaxy image decomposition technique, we extract bulge and disk structural parameters for a sample of 36 lenticular galaxies observed by us in the K band. By combining data from the literature for field and cluster lenticulars with our data, we study correlations between parameters that characterise the bulge and the disk as a function of luminosity and environment. We find that scaling relations such as the Kormendy relation, photometric plane and other correlations involving bulge and disk parameters show a luminosity dependence. This dependence can be explained in terms of galaxy formation models in which faint lenticulars (M_T > -24.5) formed via secular formation processes that likely formed the pseudobulges of late-type disk galaxies, while brighter lenticulars (M_T < -24.5) formed through a different formation mechanism most likely involving major mergers.

In our model, a preflare activity plays a crucial role in driving evaporating flows and supplying baryonic matters into the magnetosphere. The loaded baryonic matter, that is called \"prominence\", is then gradually uplifted via crustal cracking with maintaining a quasi-force-free equilibrium of the magnetosphere. Finally the prominence is erupted by the magnetic pressure force due to the loss of equilibrium triggered by the explosive magnetic reconnection. The giant flare should be induced as a final outcome of the prominence eruption accompanied by large-scale field reconfigurations. An essential difference between solar and magnetar flares is the control process of their evolutionary dynamics. The flaring activity on magnetars is mainly controlled by the radiative process unlike the solar flare governed by the electron conduction.

The case of uniform precession", "authors": ["Michael Efroimsky"], "summary": "It was believed until very recently that a near-equatorial satellite would always keep up with the planet's equator (with oscillations in inclination, but without a secular drift). As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this opinion originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct) result obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis carried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary equations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some of these terms will be nontrivial, in that they will not be amendments to the disturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's obliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this article we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We demonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be extremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be short-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40 years ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second order only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession make the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will resonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a secular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in the subsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical formalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics.", "published": "2004-08-09T22:28:03+00:00", "updated": "2010-05-22T19:46:19+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0408168v4", "doi": "10.1007/s10569-004-2415-z", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10569-004-2415-z", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408168v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0408168v4"], "journal_reference": "Celest.Mech.Dyn.Astron.91:75-108,2005", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "math.DS", "nlin.SI", "physics.class-ph"]}

Larson", "G. Williams"], "summary": "Double white dwarfs are expected to be a source of confusion-limited noise for the future gravitational wave observatory LISA. In a specific frequency range, this 'foreground noise' is predicted to rise above the instrumental noise and hinder the detection of other types of signals, e.g., gravitational waves arising from stellar mass objects inspiraling into massive black holes. In many previous studies only detached populations of compact object binaries have been considered in estimating the LISA gravitational wave foreground signal. Here, we investigate the influence of compact object detached and Roche-Lobe Overflow Galactic binaries on the shape and strength of the LISA signal. Since >99% of remnant binaries which have orbital periods within the LISA sensitivity range are white dwarf binaries, we consider only these binaries when calculating the LISA signal. We find that the contribution of RLOF binaries to the foreground noise is negligible at low frequencies, but becomes significant at higher frequencies, pushing the frequency at which the foreground noise drops below the instrumental noise to >6 mHz. We find that it is important to consider the population of mass transferring binaries in order to obtain an accurate assessment of the foreground noise on the LISA data stream. However, we estimate that there still exists a sizeable number (~11300) of Galactic double white dwarf binaries which will have a signal-to-noise ratio >5, and thus will be potentially resolvable with LISA. We present the LISA gravitational wave signal from the Galactic population of white dwarf binaries, show the most important formation channels contributing to the LISA disc and bulge populations and discuss the implications of these new findings.", "published": "2007-05-23T01:27:07+00:00", "updated": "2010-05-10T15:00:52+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.3272v3", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/1006", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/1006", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3272v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0705.3272v3"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.717:1006-1021,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We calibrate the number density, completeness, reliability and the lower mass limit of galaxy-cluster detections through their thermal SZ signal, and compare them to X-ray cluster detections. Methods. We simulate maps of the thermal SZ effect and the X-ray emission from light cones constructed in a large, hydrodynamical, cosmological simulation volume, including realistic noise contributions. The maps are convolved with linear, optimised, single- and multi-band filters to identify local peaks and their signal-to-noise ratios. The resulting peak catalogues are then compared to the halo population in the simulation volume to identify true and spurious detections. Results. Multi-band filtering improves the statistics of SZ cluster detections considerably compared to single-band filtering. Observations with the characteristics of ACT detect clusters with masses M>6-9e13 M_o/h, quite independent of redshift, reach 50% completeness at ~1e14 M_o/h and 100% completeness at ~2e14 M_o/h. Samples are contaminated by only a few per cent spurious detections. This is broadly comparable to X-ray cluster detections with XMM-Newton with 100 ks exposure time in the soft band, except that the mass limit for X-ray detections increases much more steeply with redshift than for SZ detections.

In this approach, one considers a solution to the Einstein equations for a general matter distribution and then an average of various observable quantities is taken. Such an approach became of considerable interest when it was shown that it could lead to agreement with observations without resorting to dark energy. In this paper we compare the LambdaCDM model and the backreation models with SNIa, BAO, and CMB data, and find that the former is favoured. However, the tested models were based on some particular assumptions about the relation between the average spatial curvature and the backreaction, as well as the relation between the curvature and curvature index. In this paper we modified the latter assumption, leaving the former unchanged. We find that, by varying the relation between the curvature and curvature index, we can obtain a better fit.

Our measured stellar line-of-sight velocity distributions are larger than the planetary nebulae measurements at similar radii. We fit axisymmetric orbit-superposition models with a range of dark halo density profiles, including two-dimensional kinematics at smaller radii from SAURON data. Within our assumptions, the best-fitted model gives a total enclosed mass of 2.0x10^11 M_sun within 100 arcsec, with an accuracy of 2%; this mass is equally divided between halo and stars. At 1R_e the best-fitted dark matter halo accounts for 13% of the total mass in the galaxy. This dark halo is inconsistent with previous claims of little to no dark matter halo in this galaxy from planetary nebula measurements. We find that a power-law dark halo with a slope 0.1 is the best-fitted model; both the no dark halo and NFW models are worse fits at a greater than 99% confidence level. NGC 821 does not appear to have the expected dark halo density profile. The internal moments of the stellar velocity distribution show that the model with no dark halo is radially anisotropic at small radii and tangentially isotropic at large radii, while the best-fitted halo models are slightly radially anisotropic at all radii. We test the potential effects of model smoothing and find that there are no effects on our results within the errors.

Radio pulsations in our model are caused by dissipation at the light cylinder of magnetic bubbles, produced near the ring during the X-ray outburst. The delay between X-ray peak emission and radio emission in our model is related to the propagation time of these bubbles to the light cylinder. We predict a ~1 year and ~1 month delay for XTE J1810-197 and 1E 1547.0-5408, respectively. The observed flat spectrum, erratic pulse profile, and the pulse duration are all explained in our model as a result of X-point reconnection events induced by the dissipation of the bubbles at the light cylinder. The spin down rate of the central quark star can either increase or decrease depending on how the radial drift velocity of the magnetic islands changes with distance from the central star. We suggest an evolutionary connection between transient AXPs and typical AXPs in our model.", "published": "2008-09-27T23:19:12+00:00", "updated": "2010-04-19T17:51:56+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4805v2", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200811114", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200811114", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4805v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4805v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The models are also used to predict H2O spectral line emission for the upcoming Herschel/HIFI mission. Methods: We use Infrared space observatory long wavelength spectrometer spectra to constrain the circumstellar fractional abundance distribution of ortho-H2O, using a non-local thermal equilibrium, and non-local, radiative transfer code based on the accelerated lambda iteration formalism. The mass-loss rates and kinetic temperature structures for the sample stars are determined through radiative transfer modelling of CO line emission based on the Monte-Carlo method. The density and temperature profiles of the circumstellar dust grains are determined through spectral energy distribution modelling using the publicly available code Dusty. Results: The determined ortho-H2O abundances lie between 1e-4 and 1.5e-3 relative to H2, with the exception of WX Psc, which has a much lower estimated ortho-H2O abundance of only 2e-6, possibly indicating H_2O adsorption onto dust grains or recent mass-loss-rate modulations. The estimated abundances are uncertain by, at best, a factor of a few. Conclusions: The high water abundance found for the majority of the sources suggests that either the `normal' chemical processes are very effective in producing H2O, or else non-local thermal equilibrium atmospheric chemistry, grain surface reactions, or a release of H_2O (e.g. from icy bodies like Kuiper belt objects) play a role.

Methods: The fluxes of the far-infrared [O i] and [O iii] lines are extracted from the previously unpublished archival ISO data. The archival Spitzer data are used to determine the fluxes of the O, Ne, Si, S, Ar and Fe ion fine-structure lines originating in the FMKs. The ratios of these line fluxes are used for the plasma diagnostics. We also determine the infrared line flux ratios to the optical [O iii] 5007 A line in the knots having previously measured reddening. Additionally, we analyze several optical and near-infrared observations of the FMKs to obtain clearer insight into the post-shock photoionized region (PIR) structure. Results: We show that the infrared oxygen line flux predictions of all existing theoretical models are correct only to within a factor of several. For the models to reproduce the observations it is essential to include the electron conductivity and effects of the dust. Detailed analysis of the diagnostic line flux ratios allows us to qualitatively confirm the general model of the FMK emission and to determine observationally the physical conditions in the PIR after the shock front. We infer that the pre-shock cloud densities most probably constitute several hundred particles per cm^3. We also determine the Cas A luminosities in the infrared continuum and lines.

To be causally isolated a black hole interior must trap matter fields as well as all aether and metric modes. The theory possesses spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 modes whose speeds depend on four coupling coefficients. We find that the full three-parameter family of local spherically symmetric static solutions is always regular at a metric horizon, but only a two-parameter subset is regular at a spin-0 horizon. Asymptotic flatness imposes another condition, leaving a one-parameter family of regular black holes. These solutions are compared to the Schwarzschild solution using numerical integration for a special class of coupling coefficients. They are very close to Schwarzschild outside the horizon for a wide range of couplings, and have a spacelike singularity inside, but differ inside quantitatively. Some quantities constructed from the metric and aether oscillate in the interior as the singularity is approached.

Methods: Applying a population synthesis model the inhomogeneity of the progenitor distribution and the inhomogeneity of the X-ray absorbing interstellar medium are considered for the first time. The total number of observable neutron stars is derived with respect to ROSAT count rates. In addition, we present sky maps of neutron star locations and discuss age and distance distributions of the simulated neutron stars. Implications for future searches are discussed. Results: With our advanced model we can successfully explain the observed logN - logS distribution of close-by neutron stars. Cooling neutron stars will be most abundant in the directions of rich OB associations. New candidates are expected to be identified behind the Gould Belt, in particular in the Cygnus-Cepheus region.

One recent study models the polarized radio continuum of Loop I as two magnetic shells with the Sun embedded in the rim of the 'S1' shell.

The properties of these subshells are compared to optical polarization data that trace the nearby interstellar magnetic field (ISMF), and the distribution of interstellar FeII and CaII within about 55 pc of the Sun. The result is that a model of Loop I as composed of two magnetic subshells is a viable description of the distribution of nearby low density ISM. Column densities of the recombinant ion CaII are found to increase with the strength of the interstellar radiation field, rather than with star distance or total pathlength through the two magnetic subshells.

We combine 3d radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation, describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the growth of HII regions around high redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks 1024^3 dark matter particles, in a box of co-moving side length 65.6 Mpc/h. This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of HII regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: HII regions grow collectively around highly-clustered sources, and have a well-defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to R > 10 Mpc towards the end. We present a detailed statistical description of our results, and compare them with a numerical scheme based on the analytic model by Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We find that the analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of HII regions and the 21 cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small scale structure than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys.

Use of p(z) in cosmological analyses can substantially reduce biases associated with traditional photometric redshifts, in which a single redshift estimate is associated with each galaxy. The weighting procedure also naturally indicates which galaxies in the photometric sample are expected to have accurate redshift estimates, namely those that lie in regions of photometric-observable space that are well sampled by the spectroscopic subsample. In addition to providing a method that has some advantages over standard photo-z estimates, the weights method can also be used in conjunction with photo-z estimates, e.g., by providing improved estimation of N(z) via deconvolution of N(photo-z) and improved estimates of photo-z scatter and bias.

Oldershaw"], "summary": "The scale invariance of the source-free Einstein field equations suggests that one might be able to model hadrons as \"strong gravity\" black holes, if one uses an appropriate rescaling of units or a revised gravitational coupling factor. The inner consistency of this hypothesis is tested by retrodicting a close approximation to the mass of the proton from an equation that relates the angular momentum and mass of a Kerr black hole. More accurate mass and radius values for the proton are then retrodicted using the geometrodynamics form of the full Kerr-Newman solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The radius of an alpha particle is calculated as an additional retrodictive test. In a third retrodictive test of the \"strong gravity\" hypothesis, the subatomic particle mass spectrum in the 100 MeV to 7,000 MeV range is retrodicted to a first approximation using the Kerr solution of General Relativity.

The analysis of the Mare-Nostrum simulation with our method provides strong evidence of self-similar multifractal distributions of dark matter and gas, with a halo mass function that is of Press-Schechter type but has a power-law exponent -2, as corresponds to a multifractal. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the dark matter and gas distributions are indistinguishable as multifractals. To determine if there is any gas biasing, we calculate the cross-correlation coefficient, with negative but inconclusive results. Hence, we develop an effective Bayesian analysis connected with information theory, which clearly demonstrates that the gas is biased in a long range of scales, up to the scale of homogeneity. However, entropic measures related to the Bayesian analysis show that this gas bias is small (in a precise sense) and is such that the fractal singularities of both distributions coincide and are identical.

We demonstrate that the key constraint from CMB observations arises from the location of acoustic peaks. An additional constraint arises from the limits on Omega_nr from the relative amplitudes of acoustic peaks. Further, we show that the distance to the last scattering surface is not how the CMB observations constrain the combination of parameters for models of dark energy. We also use constraints from Supernova observations and show that unlike the Gold and Silver samples, the SNLS sample prefers a region of parameter space that has a significant overlap with the region preferred by the CMB observations. This is a verification of a conjecture made by us in an earlier work. We discuss combined constraints from WMAP5 and SNLS observations. We find that models with w ~ -1 are preferred for models with a constant equation of state parameters. In case of models with a time varying dark energy, we show that constraints on evolution of dark energy density are almost independent of the type of variation assumed for the equation of state parameter.

Large values of the dark matter ratio are disfavored by an elementary effect: increasing the amount of dark matter while holding fixed the baryon to photon ratio decreases the number of baryons inside one horizon volume.

Our goal is to stress the interest of using this coronagraphic solution, in particular for instruments for which the introduction of a stellar coronagraph with Lyot stop is made impossible. We estimate the intensity attenuation achieved with SLLC and carry out our study with a focus on the case of Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). In a first step, numerical simulations are made assuming the absence of any aberration, thereafter SLLC performance is evaluated considering AO corrected wavefronts in our approach for ground-based instruments. SLLC performance proves to be equivalent to that obtained with APLC in presence of AO compensated atmospheric turbulence images, which Strehl ratio is S=0.552 at the wavelength lambda=1.57 mu m. This coronagraph allows to remove the peak intensity of a star image and therefore, avoid detector saturation. Moreover, it helps increasing the image dynamic range.

In axisymmetric simulations we find that cycles of latitudinal flows into and radial flows out of the polar regions amplify the field parallel to the symmetry axis, typically increasing the total magnetic energy by about two orders of magnitude. Nonaxisymmetric calculations result in fundamentally different flows and a larger magnetic energy increase: shearing associated with the SASI spiral mode contributes to a widespread and turbulent field amplification mechanism, boosting the magnetic energy by almost four orders of magnitude (a result which remains very sensitive to the spatial resolution of the numerical simulations). While the SASI may contribute to neutron star magnetization, these simulations do not show qualitatively new features in the global evolution of the shock as a result of SASI-induced magnetic field amplification.", "published": "2008-11-20T17:29:25+00:00", "updated": "2010-03-03T17:37:16+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3385v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/713/2/1219", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/713/2/1219", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3385v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3385v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.713:1219-1243,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

His approach was developed independently to the well-known Tryon description of the creation of the closed universe as a process of quantum fluctuation of vacuum. We apply the Fomin concept to derive the cosmological observables. We argue that Fomin's idea from his 1973 work, in contrast to Tryon's one has impact on the current Universe models and the proposed extension of his theory now can be tested by distant supernovae SNIa. Fomin's idea of the creation of the Universe is based on the intersection of two fundamental theories: general relativity and quantum field theory with the contemporary cosmological models with dark energy. As a result of comparison with contemporary approaches concerning dark energy, we found out that Fomin's idea appears in the context of the present acceleration of the Universe explanation: cosmological models with decaying vacuum. Contemporary it appears in the form of Ricci scalar dark energy connected with the holographic principle. We show also that the Fomin model admits the bounce instead of the initial singularity. We demonstrate that the Fomin model of cosmogenesis can be falsified and using SNIa data the values of model parameters is in agreement with observations.", "published": "2006-04-01T11:05:46+00:00", "updated": "2010-02-28T18:36:26+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0604005v5", "doi": "10.1134/S0202289310020052", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0202289310020052", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604005v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0604005v5"], "journal_reference": "Grav.Cosmol.16:126-136,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

The lack of independent distance measurements for most of these sources, however, prevents a systematic exploration of the masses and radii of the neutron stars, hence limiting the equation of state studies. We present here a measurement of the distance to the low mass X-ray binary 4U 1608-52 that is based on the study of the interstellar extinction towards the source. We first model the individual absorption edges of the elements Ne and Mg in the high resolution X-ray spectrum obtained with XMM-Newton. We then combine this information with a measurement of the run of reddening with distance using red clump stars and determine a minimum distance to the source of 3.9 kpc, with a most probable value of 5.8 kpc. Finally, we analyze time-resolved X-ray spectra of Type-I X-ray bursts observed from this source to measure the mass and the radius of the neutron star.

We have obtained optical spectroscopy for 44 Sculptor Group GC candidates with the Boller and Chivens (B&C) spectrograph on the Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. There are 2 GCs in NGC 253 and 12 objects in NGC 300 with globular-cluster-like spectral features, 9 of which have radial velocities above 0 km/s. The remaining three, due to their radial velocities being below the expected 95% confidence limit for velocities of NGC 300 halo objects, are flagged as possible foreground stars. The non-clusterlike candidates included 13 stars, 15 galaxies, and an HII region. One GC, four galaxies, two stars, and the HII region from our sample were identified in archival Hubble Space Telescope images. For the GCs, we measure spectral indices and estimate metallicities using an empirical calibration based on Milky Way GCs. The GCs of NGC 300 appear similar to those of the Milky Way. Excluding possible stars and including clusters from the literature, the GC system (GCS) has a velocity dispersion of 68 km/s, and has no clear evidence of rotation. The mean metallicity for our full cluster sample plus one literature object is [Fe/H] = -0.94, lying above the relationship between mean GC metallicity and overall galaxy luminosity. Excluding the three low-velocity candidates, we obtain a mean [Fe/H] = -0.98, still higher than expected, raising the possibility of significant foreground star contamination even in this sample.

We study the propagation of light in this background, assuming that the source and the observer occupy random positions, so that each beam travels through several inhomogeneities at random angles. The distribution of luminosity distances for sources with the same redshift is asymmetric, with a peak at a value larger than the average one. The width of the distribution and the location of the maximum increase with increasing redshift and length scale of the inhomogeneities. We compute the induced dispersion and bias on cosmological parameters derived from the supernova data.

For the vast majority of the objects the derived MBH upper limits run parallel and above the well-known MBH-sigma relation independently of the galaxy distance, suggesting that our nebular line-width measurements trace rather well the nuclear gravitational potential. For values of sigma between 90 and 220km/s the 68% of our upper limits falls immediately above the MBH-sigma relation without exceeding the expected MBH values by more than a factor 4.1. No systematic trends or offsets are observed in this sigma range as a function of the galaxy Hubble type or with respect to the presence of a bar. For 6 of our 12 MBH upper limits with sigma<90km/s our line-width measurements are more sensitive to the stellar contribution to the gravitational potential, either due to the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster or because of a greater distance compared to the other galaxies at the low-sigma end of the MBH-sigma relation. Conversely, our MBH upper bounds appear to lie closer to the expected MBH in the most massive elliptical galaxies with values of sigma above 220km/s. Such a flattening of the MBH-sigma relation at its high-sigma end would appear consistent with a coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies driven by dry mergers, although better and more consistent measurements for sigma and K-band luminosity are needed for these kind of objects before systematic effects can be ruled out.", "published": "2008-09-30T14:16:29+00:00", "updated": "2010-02-09T12:05:49+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.5103v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/692/1/856", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/692/1/856", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.5103v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.5103v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.692:856-868,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Arguments are then given to the effect that traditional assumptions concerning the behavior of negative-action matter give rise to violations of both the principle of relativity and the principle of inertia. An alternative set of axioms is proposed that would govern the behavior of negative-action matter if it is to be considered a viable element of physical theories upon which cosmological models are build. A simple framework, based on general relativity and the proposed axioms, is elaborated which enables the formulation of quantitative predictions concerning the interaction between positive and negative-action bodies. Based on those developments, a solution is proposed to the problem of the discrepancy between current experimental and theoretical values of vacuum energy density (in any cosmological model), which may also constitute a solution to the problem of the unexplained coincidence between the (model-dependent) experimental values of vacuum energy density and present-day, average, matter energy density.

Such interactions give rise to new features in cosmological structure growth, like an additional long-range attractive force between CDM particles, or variations of the dark matter particle mass with time. We have implemented these effects in the N-body code GADGET-2 and present results of a series of high-resolution N-body simulations where the dark energy component is directly interacting with the cold dark matter. As a consequence of the new physics, CDM and baryon distributions evolve differently both in the linear and in the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Already on large scales a linear bias develops between these two components, which is further enhanced by the nonlinear evolution. We also find, in contrast with previous work, that the density profiles of CDM halos are less concentrated in coupled dark energy cosmologies compared with LCDM, and that this feature does not depend on the initial conditions setup, but is a specific consequence of the extra physics induced by the coupling. Also, the baryon fraction in halos in the coupled models is significantly reduced below the universal baryon fraction. These features alleviate tensions between observations and the LCDM model on small scales.

We search for infall patterns around the groups and use these to measure group mass profiles to large radii. In previous work, we analyzed infall patterns for an X-ray-selected sample of 72 clusters from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Here, we extend this approach to a sample of systems with smaller X-ray fluxes selected from the 400 Square Degree serendipitous survey of clusters and groups in ROSAT pointed observations. We identify 16 groups with SDSS DR5 spectroscopy, search for infall patterns, and compute mass profiles out to 2-6 Mpc from the group centers with the caustic technique. No other mass estimation methods are currently available at such large radii for these low-mass groups, because the virial estimate requires dynamical equilibrium and the gravitational lensing signal is too weak. Despite the small masses of these groups, most display recognizable infall patterns. We use caustic and virial mass estimates to measure the scaling relations between different observables, extending these relations to smaller fluxes and luminosities than many previous surveys. Close inspection reveals that three of the groups are subclusters in the outskirts of larger clusters. A fourth group is apparently undergoing a group-group merger. These four merging groups represent the most extreme outliers in the scaling relations.

We avail ourselves of bimetric VSL theories, where the speed of gravity differs from that of light.

We then examine the map between bimetric and $K$-essence models: typically the bi-scalar connecting the two metrics is a $K$-essence field in one of them. Remarkably, the DBI model is found to perturbatively represent the minimal bimetric model, where the bi-scalar is Klein-Gordon in the matter frame. But the full non-perturbative bimetric structure is even simpler: the bi-scalar dynamics should be simply driven by a cosmological constant in the matter frame, balanced by an opposite cosmological constant in the gravity frame. Thus the problem of structure formation receives an elegant and universal solution within bimetric VSL theories, which are known to also solve the flatness and entropy problems and evade a plethora of causality concerns.", "published": "2008-07-10T16:01:12+00:00", "updated": "2010-01-29T17:41:28+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1689v2", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.79.043525", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.79.043525", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1689v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.1689v2"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rev.D79:043525,2009", "primary_category": "gr-qc", "categories": ["gr-qc", "astro-ph", "hep-th"]}

A variety of possible sources of microsecond to millisecond radio pulses have been suggested in the last several decades, among them such exotic events as evaporating primordial black holes, hyper-flares from neutron stars, emissions from cosmic strings or perhaps extraterrestrial civilizations, but to-date few searches have been conducted capable of detecting them. We are carrying out two searches in hopes of finding and characterizing these mu-s to ms time scale dispersed radio pulses. These two observing programs are orthogonal in search space; the Allen Telescope Array's (ATA) \"Fly's Eye\" experiment observes a 100 square degree field by pointing each 6m ATA antenna in a different direction; by contrast, the Astropulse sky survey at Arecibo is extremely sensitive but has 1/3,000 of the instantaneous sky coverage. Astropulse's multibeam data is transferred via the internet to the computers of millions of volunteers. These computers perform a coherent de-dispersion analysis faster than the fastest available supercomputers and allow us to resolve pulses as short as 400 ns. Overall, the Astropulse survey will be 30 times more sensitive than the best previous searches. Analysis of results from Astropulse is at a very early stage. The Fly's Eye was successfully installed at the ATA in December of 2007, and to-date approximately 450 hours of observation has been performed. We have detected three pulsars and six giant pulses from the Crab pulsar in our diagnostic pointing data.

Using the formalism, we demonstrate that the flavor conversions may be \"factorized\" into two-flavor oscillations with hierarchical frequencies. We explicitly show how the three-flavor solution may be constructed by combining two-flavor solutions. For a typical supernova density profile, we identify an approximate separation of regions where distinctly different flavor conversion mechanisms operate, and demonstrate the interplay between collective and MSW effects.

The density of such a substance(usually called phantom energy) grows with the cosmological expansion and may become infinite in a finite time producing a Big Rip. In this Letter we analyze the late stages of the universe evolution and demonstrate that the presence of the phantom energy in the universe is not enough in itself to produce the Big Rip. This singularity occurrence requires the fulfillment of some additional, rather strong conditions. A more probable outcome of the cosmological evolution is the decay of the phantom field into 'normal' matter. The second, more intriguing consequence of the presence of the phantom field is the possibility to introduce a cosmological scenario that does not contain a Big Bang.

Such an orbital configuration yields an ideal situation, in principle, to attempt a measurement of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect through the Juno's node Omega which would be displaced by about 570 m over the mission's duration. Conversely, by assuming the validity of general relativity, the proposed test can be viewed as a direct, dynamical measurement of the Jupiter's angular momentum S which would give important information concerning the internal structure and formation of the giant planet. The long-period orbital perturbations due to the zonal harmonic coefficients J_L, L=2,3,4,6 of the multipolar expansion of the jovian gravitational potential accounting for its departures from spherical symmetry are a major source of systematic bias. While the Lense-Thirring node rate is independent of the inclination i, the node zonal perturbations vanish for i=90. In reality, the orbit injection errors will induce departures \\delta i from the ideal polar geometry, so that the zonal perturbations will come into play at an unacceptably high level, in spite of the expected improvements in the low-degree zonals by Juno. A linear combination of Omega, the periJove omega and the mean anomaly M cancels out the impact of J_2 and J_6.

It is shown that the application of a perturbative approach to MaVaN mechanisms translates into a constraint on the coefficient of a linear perturbation, which depends on the ratio between a neutrino energy dependent term and scalar field potential terms. We quantify the effects on the MaVaN sector by considering neutrino masses generated by the seesaw mechanism. After setting the GCG parameters in agreement with general cosmological constraints, we find that the squared speed of sound in the neutrino-scalar GCG fluid is naturally positive.

Reduced planetary masses produce stability only for unreasonably small planets (<~2 M_ Jup). Relaxing the face-on assumption, but still requiring circular orbits while fitting the observed positions, makes the instability time even shorter. A promising solution is that the inner two planets have a 2:1 commensurability between their periods, and they avoid close encounters with each other through this resonance. That the inner resonance has lasted until now, in spite of the perturbations of the outer planet, leads to a limit <~10 M_Jup on the masses unless the outer two planets are also engaged in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance. In a double resonance, which is consistent with the current data, the system could survive until now even if the planets have masses of ~20 M_Jup.

The Planck satellite mission observes the sky from 30 to 857 GHz and therefore we focus on the millimetre region. We use radio and submillimetre data from the WMAP satellite between 23 and 94 GHz (from 13 to 3.18 mm) and from the Archeops balloon experiment between 143 (2.1 mm) and 545 GHz (0.55 mm), and a compendium of other Crab Nebula observations. The Crab SED is compared to models including three main components : synchrotron which is responsible for the emission at low and at high frequencies, dust which explains the excess of flux observed by the IRAS satellite and an extra component on the millimetre regime. From this analysis we conclude that the unpolarised emission of the Crab Nebula at microwave and millimetre wavelengths is the same synchrotron emission that the one observed in the radio domain.

We set upper limits on the possible errors induced by any millimetre extra component on the reconstruction of the degree and angle of polarisation at the percent level as a maximum.

We assume the fast polar wind is clumpy, which is typical for radiatively-driven winds. The clumpiness cause the two winds to mix. The relativistic electrons from the pulsar wind are retained in the moving clumps by inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, which explains the X-ray variability observed on time scales much shorter than the orbital period. We calculate detailed inhomogeneous spectral models reproducing the average broad-band spectrum from radio to TeVs. Given the uncertainties the form of the distribution of relativistic electrons, the X-ray spectrum could be dominated by either Compton or synchrotron emission. The recent Fermi observations constrain the high-energy cut-off in the electron distribution to be at the Lorentz factor of 2 10^4 or 10^8 in the former and latter model, respectively. We provide formulae comparing the losses of the relativistic electrons due to Compton, synchrotron and Coulomb processes vs. the distance from the Be star. We calculate the optical depth of the wind to free-free absorption, showing that it will suppress most of the radio emission within the orbit.

These models can be used to describe network evolution for non-abelian strings as well as cosmic superstrings. The application to $Z_{N}$ strings in which interactions are topologically constrained, demonstrates that a scaling regime is generally reached which involves a hierarchy of string densities with the lightest most abundant. We also study hybrid networks of cosmic superstrings, where energetic considerations are more important in determining interaction outcomes. We again find that networks tend towards scaling, with the three lightest network components being dominant and having comparable number densities, while the heavier string states are suppressed.

In Einstein-Hilbert action equations are second order, so the fall off of the fields suffices to single out a unique solution. In 1/R gravity the equations are fourth order, so we should impose additional boundary conditions. Perhaps the boundary condition we must impose is that the abrupt change in the second derivative of the metric near the surface of the Sun remains intact by adding `1/R' corrections to the equations of motion. The solution of 1/R gravity with this boundary condition remains consistent with the solar system tests. Ref.

Over 18% of the HI mass of M33 (M_HI(tot) =1.4 x 10^9 Msun) is found beyond the star forming disk as traced in the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to 22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk) and the gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are catalogued in the vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31 halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal disruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown from an orbit analysis which results in a tidal radius < 15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits. M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31 and the gas appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km/s) may also be consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33 will either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually become star formation fuel for M31.

We explore the possibility that they could be observably large in CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data. We find that a k^3 component with a cutoff at some maximum k can modestly improve the fits (Delta chi^2=2.0, 5.4) of the low multipoles (l ~ 10 - 50) or the second peak (l ~ 540) of the CMB angular spectrum when the three-year WMAP data are used. Moreover, the results from WMAP are consistent with the CBI, ACBAR, 2dFGRS, and SDSS data when they are included in the analysis. Including the SDSS galaxy clustering power spectrum, we find weak positive evidence for the k^3 component at the level of Delta chi' = 2.4, with the caveat that the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum may not be properly treated in the presence of the k^3 distortion. To investigate the high-k regime, we use the Lyman-alpha forest data (LUQAS, Croft et al., and SDSS Lyman-alpha); here we find evidence at the level Delta chi^2' = 3.8. Considering that there are two additional free parameters in the model, the above results do not give a strong evidence for features; however, they show that surprisingly large bumps are not ruled out. We give constraints on the ratio between the k^3 component and the nearly scale-invariant component, r_3 < 1.5, over the range of wave numbers 0.0023/Mpc < k < 8.2/Mpc. We also discuss theoretical models which could lead to the k^3 effect, including ordinary hybrid inflation and double D-term inflation models.

The first published reduction, analysis, and interpretation of the CoRoT data yielded a spectrum of p-modes with l = 0, 1, and 2. Aims: We present our own analysis of the CoRoT data in an attempt to compare the detected pulsation modes with eigenfrequencies of models that are consistent with the observed luminosity and surface temperature. Methods: We used the Gruberbauer et al. frequency set derived based on a more conservative Bayesian analysis with ignorance priors and fit models from a dense grid of model spectra. We also introduce a Bayesian approach to searching and quantifying the best model fits to the observed oscillation spectra. Results: We identify 26 frequencies as radial and dipolar modes. Our best fitting model has solar composition and coincides within the error box with the spectroscopically determined position of HD49933 in the H-R diagram. We also show that lower-than-solar Z models have a lower probability of matching the observations than the solar metallicity models.

Over the last decade enough theoretical and observational evidence have accumulated to believe that many galactic globular clusters may host IMBHs in the centres, just like galaxies do. The well-established correlations for supermassive black holes and their galaxies do suggest that, in extrapolation, globular clusters (GCs) follow the same relations. Most of the attempts in search of the central black holes (BHs) are not direct and present enormous observational difficulties due to the crowding of stars in the GC cores. Here we propose a new method of detection of the central BH--the microlensing of the cluster stars by the central black hole. If the core of the cluster is resolved, the direct determination of the lensing curve and lensing system parameters is possible; if unresolved, the differential imaging technique (or pixel lensing) can be applied. We calculate the optical depth to central BH microlensing for a selected list of Galactic globular clusters and estimate the average time duration of the events.

However, the observed optical flashes accompanying GRBs suggest that the delayed residual collisions due to large timescale variation continue to accelerate electrons. We show here that the inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of the prompt gamma-rays by these residual internal shock electrons leads to a high energy emission beyond the previously thought spectral cutoff, in agreement with the previous detections of GeV photons by EGRET in several GRBs in conjunction with MeV emission. We expect a spectral break due to the transition from the primary to residual internal shock emission at the previously thought spectral cutoff, and expect systematic time delays of high energy photons relative to MeV emission, the discovery of which would provide stringent constraint on the outflow properties, but requires large enough collection of high energy photons by, e.g., Fermi and AGILE satellites. The recent Fermi-detected bright GRB 080916c unambiguously shows the shifting of the prompt emission toward later times as the photon energy increases, as predicted in the residual collision model. The detected prompt, highest energy photon (about 70 GeV in the rest frame of the GRB) may not be produced by primary internal shocks but by IC emission in residual collisions.

We also derive the velocity structure functions and we recover the bifractality of the inverse Lagrangian map. Then, for the case where the initial density is uniform, we obtain the distribution of the density field and its $n$-point correlations. In the same limit, we derive the $n-$point distributions of the Lagrangian displacement field and the properties of shocks.

Data from the fourth LIGO science run (S4) have been used in this search. Three different semi-coherent methods of transforming and summing strain power from Short Fourier Transforms (SFTs) of the calibrated data have been used. The first, known as \"StackSlide\", averages normalized power from each SFT. A \"weighted Hough\" scheme is also developed and used, and which also allows for a multi-interferometer search. The third method, known as \"PowerFlux\", is a variant of the StackSlide method in which the power is weighted before summing. In both the weighted Hough and PowerFlux methods, the weights are chosen according to the noise and detector antenna-pattern to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The respective advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed. Observing no evidence of periodic gravitational radiation, we report upper limits; we interpret these as limits on this radiation from isolated rotating neutron stars. The best population-based upper limit with 95% confidence on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude, found for simulated sources distributed isotropically across the sky and with isotropically distributed spin-axes, is 4.28E-24 (near 140 Hz).

However, cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of the power spectrum varies with mass scale dramatically in the so-called concordance Lambda CDM cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its structural evolution should work well simultaneously for various cosmological models and different power spectra. We use a large set of high-resolution N-body simulations of a variety of structure formation models (scale-free, standard CDM, open CDM, and Lambda CDM) to study the mass accretion histories (MAHs), the mass and redshift dependence of concentrations and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. According to two simple but tight correlations we find from the simulation results, we develop new empirical models for both the MAHs and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These models are accurate and universal: the same set of model parameters works well for different cosmological models and for halos of different masses at different redshifts and the model predictions are highly accurate even when the histories are traced to very high redshift. These models are also simple and easy to implement. A web calculator and a user-friendly code to make the relevant calculations are available from http://www.shao.ac.cn/dhzhao/mandc.html .

High resolution rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles along two perpendicular directions, close to the major and minor axes of the lens galaxy, were obtained by fitting the Mgb-Fe absorption line region. The stellar rotation curve rises slowly and flattens at r~1.5\" (~1.1 kpc). The velocity dispersion profile is approximately flat. A combination of photometric, kinematic and lensing information is used to construct a mass model for the four major mass components of the system -- the dark matter halo, disc, bulge, and bar. The best-fitting solution has a dark matter halo with a logarithmic inner density slope of gamma=0.9+/-0.3 for rho_DM propto r^-gamma, a bulge with M/L_B=6.6+/-0.3 Upsilon_odot, and a disc with M/L_B =1.2+/-0.3 Upsilon_odot, in agreement with measurements of late-type spirals.

This fact as well as all interesting departures from GR are fully captured by a four-dimensional effective Lagrangian, valid at distances smaller than the present Hubble scale. The 4D effective theory involves a relativistic scalar \\pi, universally coupled to matter and with peculiar derivative self-interactions. In this paper, we study the connection between self-acceleration and the presence of ghosts for a quite generic class of theories that modify gravity in the infrared. These theories are defined as those that at distances shorter than cosmological, reduce to a certain generalization of the DGP 4D effective theory. We argue that for infrared modifications of GR locally due to a universally coupled scalar, our generalization is the only one that allows for a robust implementation of the Vainshtein effect--the decoupling of the scalar from matter in gravitationally bound systems--necessary to recover agreement with solar system tests. Our generalization involves an internal ``galilean'' invariance, under which \\pi's gradient shifts by a constant. This symmetry constrains the structure of the \\pi Lagrangian so much so that in 4D there exist only five terms that can yield sizable non-linearities without introducing ghosts. We show that for such theories in fact there are ``self-accelerating'' deSitter solutions with no ghost-like instabilities. In the presence of compact sources, these solutions can support spherically symmetric, Vainshtein-like non-linear perturbations that are also stable against small fluctuations.

The basis for our analysis is a chiral quark matter model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the spin-1 single flavor (CSL), spin-0 two flavor (2SC) and three flavor (CFL) channels. We find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0, when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor asymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0 u-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase is formed. The s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density, when the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically generated strange quark mass. We construct two different hybrid equations of state (EoS) using the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and the EoS by Shen et al. in the nuclear matter sector. The corresponding hybrid star sequences have maximum masses of, respectively, 2.1 and 2.0 M_sun. Two- and three-flavor quark-matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star solutions in the DBHF case, while the Shen-based EoS produce stable configurations with a 2SC phase-component in the core of massive stars.

Observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giant stars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of open questions yet to be explored. Although stochastic oscillations have previously been detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometric measurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was not complete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. The quality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the CoRoT satellite is necessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in red giants. We have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400 relatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of CoRoT during the first 150 days long-run campaign from May to October 2007. We find several hundred stars showing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected for red-giant pulsators. In this paper we present first results on a sub-sample of these stars. Aims. Knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radius is essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. As the CoRoT exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or only weak) constraints on the star's location in the H-R diagram. We therefore aim to extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from the available time series. Methods. We model the convective background noise and the power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deduce reliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations for the frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequency separation.", "published": "2008-11-28T09:11:10+00:00", "updated": "2009-11-23T23:18:44+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.4674v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4674v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.4674v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The detection of bursts at this early epoch of the Universe significantly constrains the nature of GRBs and their progenitors. We perform population synthesis studies of the formation and evolution of early stars, and calculate the resulting formation rates of short and long-duration GRBs at high redshift. The peak of the GRB rate from Population II stars occurs at z=7 for a model with efficient/fast mixing of metals, while it is found at z=3 for an inefficient/slow metallicity evolution model. We show that in the redshift range 6<z<10 essentially all GRBs originate from Population II stars, regardless of metallicity evolution model. These stars (having small, but non-zero metallicity) are the most likely progenitors for both long GRBs (collapsars) and short GRBs (NS-NS or BH-NS mergers) at this epoch. Although the predicted intrinsic rates of long and short GRBs are similar at these high redshifts, observational selection effects lead to higher (factor of 10) observed rates for long GRBs.

We assume that the total (luminous plus dark) mass profile of a galaxy is isothermal in the optical region for 0 < z < 1 as suggested by mass modelling of lensing galaxies. For the evolutionary behaviours of the VDFs we find that: (1) the number density of massive (mostly early-type) galaxies with sigma > 200 km/s evolves differentially in the way that the number density evolution is greater at a higher velocity dispersion; (2) the number density of intermediate and low mass early-type galaxies (95 km/s < sigma < 200 km/s) is nearly constant; (3) the late-type VDF transformed from the Monte Carlo realised circular velocity function is consistent with no evolution in its shape or integrated number density consistent with galaxy survey results. These evolutionary behaviours of the VDFs are strikingly similar to those of the dark halo mass function (DMF) from N-body simulations and the stellar mass function (SMF) predicted by recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation under the current LambdaCDM hierarchical structure formation paradigm. Interestingly, the VDF evolutions appear to be qualitatively different from ``stellar mass-downsizing'' evolutions obtained by many galaxy surveys.

Winkler"], "summary": "Linear cosmological perturbation theory is pivotal to a theoretical understanding of current cosmological experimental data provided e.g. by cosmic microwave anisotropy probes. A key issue in that theory is to extract the gauge invariant degrees of freedom which allow unambiguous comparison between theory and experiment. When one goes beyond first (linear) order, the task of writing the Einstein equations expanded to n'th order in terms of quantities that are gauge invariant up to terms of higher orders becomes highly non-trivial and cumbersome. This fact has prevented progress for instance on the issue of the stability of linear perturbation theory and is a subject of current debate in the literature. In this series of papers we circumvent these difficulties by passing to a manifestly gauge invariant framework. In other words, we only perturb gauge invariant, i.e. measurable quantities, rather than gauge variant ones. Thus, gauge invariance is preserved non perturbatively while we construct the perturbation theory for the equations of motion for the gauge invariant observables to all orders. In this first paper we develop the general framework which is based on a seminal paper due to Brown and Kuchar as well as the realtional formalism due to Rovelli. In the second, companion, paper we apply our general theory to FRW cosmologies and derive the deviations from the standard treatment in linear order. As it turns out, these deviations are negligible in the late universe, thus our theory is in agreement with the standard treatment. However, the real strength of our formalism is that it admits a straightforward and unambiguous, gauge invariant generalisation to higher orders.

We place this problem in a cosmological context, deriving an expression for the linear potentials which control the cosmological bending of light, finding that it has no explicit dependence on the cosmological constant. To explore the physical origins of the apparent Lambda-dependent potential that appears in the static Kottler metric, we highlight the two classical effects which lead to the aberration of light. The first relates to the observer's motion relative to the source, and encapsulates the familiar concept of angular-diameter distance. The second term, which has proved to be the source of debate, arises from cosmic acceleration, but is rarely considered since it vanishes for photons with radial motion. This apparent form of light-bending gives the appearance of curved geodesics even within a flat and homogeneous universe. However this cannot be construed as a real lensing effect, since its value depends on the observer's frame of reference. Our conclusion is thus that standard results for gravitational lensing in a universe containing Lambda do not require modification, with any influence of Lambda being restricted to negligible high-order terms.", "published": "2008-09-10T16:46:22+00:00", "updated": "2009-11-14T14:04:55+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1819v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.16032.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.16032.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1819v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1819v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

We provide a simple 'universal' fitting formula that describes our derived merger rates for dark matter halos a function of dark halo mass, merger mass ratio, and redshift, and go on to predict galaxy merger rates using number density-matching to associate halos with galaxies. For example, we find that the instantaneous merger rate of m/M>0.3 mass ratio events into typical L > f L* galaxies follows the simple relation dN/dt=0.03(1+f)(1+z)^2.1 Gyr^-1. Despite the rapid increase in merger rate with redshift, only a small fraction of >0.4 L* high-redshift galaxies (~3% at z=2) should have experienced a major merger (m/M >0.3) in the very recent past (t< 100 Myr). This suggests that short-lived, merger-induced bursts of star formation should not contribute significantly to the global star formation rate at early times, in agreement with observational indications. We emphasize that great care must be made in comparisons to observations because the predicted observables depend very sensitively on galaxy luminosity, redshift, overall mass ratio, and uncertain relaxation timescales for merger remnants. We show that the majority of bright galaxies at z=3 should have undergone a major merger (>0.3) in the last 700 Myr and conclude that mergers almost certainly play an important role in delivering baryons and influencing the kinematic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs).

The X-ray observations of the flare taken from the RHESSI spacecraft reveal two phases of the flare evolution. The first phase is characterized by the altitude decrease of the X-ray looptop (LT) source for $\\sim$11 minutes. Such a long duration of the descending LT source motion is reported for the first time. The EUV loops, located below the X-ray LT source, also undergo contraction with similar speed ($\\sim$15 km s$^{-1}$) in this interval. During the second phase the two distinct hard X-ray footpoints (FP) sources are observed which correlate well with UV and H$\\alpha$ flare ribbons. The X-ray LT source now exhibits upward motion. The RHESSI spectra during the first phase are soft and indicative of hot thermal emission from flaring loops with temperatures $T>25$ MK at the early stage. On the other hand, the spectra at high energies ($\\varepsilon \\gtrsim$25 keV) follow hard power laws during the second phase ($\\gamma = 2.6-2.8$). We show that the observed motion of the LT and FP sources can be understood as a consequence of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection at a separator in the corona. During the first phase of the flare, the reconnection releases an excess of magnetic energy related to the magnetic tensions generated before a flare by the shear flows in the photosphere. The relaxation of the associated magnetic shear in the corona by the reconnection process explains the descending motion of the LT source.

For a passive scalar there is just turbulent diffusion, where the mean flux of concentration depends on the gradient of the mean concentration. However, these proportionalities are approximations that are valid only if the mean field or the mean concentration vary slowly in time. Examples are presented where turbulent transport possesses memory, i.e. where it depends crucially on the past history of the mean field. Such effects are captured by replacing turbulent transport coefficients with time integral kernels, resulting in transport coefficients that depend effectively on the frequency or the growth rate of the mean field itself.

The integral kernels can then be used to find self-consistent growth or decay rates of the mean fields.

Velocity, density and temperature profiles across the tail are obtained. Several cases with different flow parameters are considered in order to study the relative importance of viscous-like effects and the coupling between species on the flow dynamics. Assuming a Mach number equal to 2 for the incident solar wind as it flows past the comet nucleus, the flow exhibits three transitions with location and properties depending on the Reynolds number for each species and on the ratio of the timescale for inter-species coupling to the crossing time of the free flowing solar wind. By comparing our results with the measurements taken in situ by the Giotto spacecraft during its flyby of comet Halley we constrain the flow parameters for both plasmas. In the context of our approximations, we find that our model is qualitatively consistent with the in situ measurements as long as the Reynolds number of the solar wind protons and of cometary H2O+ ions is low, less than 100, suggesting that viscous-like momentum transport processes may play an important role in the interaction of the solar wind and the plasma environment of comets.", "published": "2008-12-05T17:52:29+00:00", "updated": "2009-11-12T19:14:26+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1189v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1189v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1189v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

In particular, we characterize the first three leading terms in the asymptotic expression of the joint probability density function (p.d.f.) of the random shear tensor at a general point in the lens plane due to point masses in the limit of an infinite number of stars. Up to this order, the p.d.f. depends on the magnitude of the shear tensor, the optical depth, and the mean number of stars through a combination of radial position and the stars' masses. As a consequence, the p.d.f.s of the shear components are seen to converge, in the limit of an infinite number of stars, to shifted Cauchy distributions, which shows that the shear components have heavy tails in that limit. The asymptotic p.d.f. of the shear magnitude in the limit of an infinite number of stars is also presented. Extending to general random distributions of the lenses, we employ the Kac-Rice formula and Morse theory to deduce general formulas for the expected total number of images and the expected number of saddle images. We further generalize these results by considering random sources defined on a countable compact covering of the light source plane. This is done to introduce the notion of {\\it global} expected number of positive parity images due to a general lensing map. Applying the result to microlensing, we calculate the asymptotic global expected number of minimum images in the limit of an infinite number of stars, where the stars are uniformly distributed.

For a linear data model, a number of known and novel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signal prior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes are derived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper tries to unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonov regularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularization techniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptotic regularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson, Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based on Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. The structures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, based on an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fourier transforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter in the novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes are benchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured white and Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numerical Krylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity. These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of sampling techniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how the space of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and the power spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process.

Our model naturally predicts that the SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of 0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the red-giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be explained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of the metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the binary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H]<-1, e.g., high-z spiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small. Our SN Ia model can give better reproduction of the [(alpha, Mn, Zn)/Fe]-[Fe/H] relations in the solar neighborhood than other models such as the double-degenerate scenario. The metallicity effect is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of SNe Ia. We also succeed in reproducing the galactic supernova rates with their dependence on the morphological type of galaxies, and the cosmic SN Ia rate history with a peak at z~1. At z>1, the predicted SN Ia rate decreases toward higher redshifts and SNe Ia will be observed only in the systems that have evolved with a short timescale of chemical enrichment.

We review our current knowledge of Galactic polarized emission at microwave frequencies, including synchrotron and thermal dust emission. We use existing data and our understanding of the physical behavior of the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start to assess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated from foreground contaminants for a CMBPol mission. At the estimated foreground minimum of ~100 GHz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than a primordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r=0.01, in a small patch (~1%) of the sky known to have low Galactic emission. Over 75% of the sky we expect the foreground amplitude to exceed the primordial signal by about a factor of eight at the foreground minimum and on scales of two degrees. Only on the largest scales does the polarized foreground amplitude exceed the primordial signal by a larger factor of about 20. The prospects for detecting an r=0.01 signal including degree-scale measurements appear promising, with 5 sigma_r ~0.003 forecast from multiple methods. A mission that observes a range of scales offers better prospects from the foregrounds perspective than one targeting only the lowest few multipoles. We begin to explore how optimizing the composition of frequency channels in the focal plane can maximize our ability to perform component separation, with a range of typically 40 < nu < 300 GHz preferred for ten channels.

We use a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to estimate the polarized CMB map, containing Q and U Stokes parameters at each pixel, and its covariance matrix. These can be used as inputs for cosmological analyses. The polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of three components: CMB, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. The polarized Galactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectral indices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and their component maps are estimated as by-products. We apply the method to simulated low resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and full noise realizations drawn from the WMAP noise matrices. The CMB maps are recovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. Computing the likelihood of the E-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization, tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for a simulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations. A `null' simulation with no polarized CMB signal has maximum likelihood consistent with tau=0. The method is applied to the five-year WMAP data, using the K, Ka, Q and V channels. We find tau=0.090+-0.019, compared to tau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary WMAP analysis. The synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over high signal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)<0.25, but excluding ~6% of the sky masked in the Galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04.

Our Boosted Median Continuum maps the EWs more robustly than the side-band method, minimising the effect from neighbouring absorption lines and reducing the age-metallicity degeneracy. We concentrate on Balmer lines (Hbeta,Hgamma,Hdelta), the G band and the 4000A break as age-sensitive indicators, and on the combination [MgFe] as the main metallicity indicator. We go beyond the standard comparison of the observations with simple stellar populations (SSP) and consider various models to describe the star formation histories, either with a continuous star formation rate or with a mixture of two different SSPs. Composite models are found to give more consistent fits among individual line strengths and agree with an independent estimate using the spectral energy distribution. Our age and metallicity estimates correlate well with stellar mass or velocity dispersion, with a significant threshold around 5E10 Msun above which galaxies are uniformly old and metal rich.

The chromospheric diagnostic was built with a statistically significant sample, covering nine years of observations, and including 175 solar neighborhood stars. Regarding the age indicator, the presence of stars for which very accurate ages are determined, such as those belonging to clusters and kinematic groups, lends confidence to our analysis. We also investigate the possibility that stars of the same age might have gone through different tracks of chromospheric decay, identifying - within the same age range - effects of metallicity and mass. These parameters, however, as well as age, seem to be significant only for dwarf stars, losing their meaning when we analyze stars in the subgiant branch. This result suggests that, in these evolved stars, the emission mechanism cannot be magnetohydrodynamical in nature, in agreement with recent models (Fawzy et al. 2002c, and references therein). The Sun is found to be a typical star in its H-alpha chromospheric flux, for its age, mass and metallicity.

As an alternative we present a functional form filling technique in which an unknown, residual, systematic is treated as such. Since the underlying function is unknown we evaluate the effect of every functional form allowed by the information available (either a hard boundary or some data). Using a simple toy model we introduce the formalism of functional form filling. We show that parameter errors can be dramatically affected by the choice of function in the case of marginalising over a systematic, but that in contrast the functional form filling approach is independent of the choice of basis set. We then apply the technique to cosmic shear shape measurement systematics and show that a shear calibration bias of |m(z)|< 0.001(1+z)^0.7 is required for a future all-sky photometric survey to yield unbiased cosmological parameter constraints to percent accuracy.

The morphology of the shock becomes highly anisotropic once it leaves the host halo and encounters filaments and neighboring minihalos, while the bulk of the shock propagates into the voids of the intergalactic medium. The SN entirely disrupts the host halo and terminates further star formation for at least 200 Myr, while in our specific case it exerts positive mechanical feedback on neighboring minihalos by shock-compressing their cores. In contrast, we do not observe secondary star formation in the dense shell via gravitational fragmentation, due to the previous photoheating by the progenitor star. We find that cooling by metal lines is unimportant for the entire evolution of the SN remnant, while the metal-enriched, interior bubble expands adiabatically into the cavities created by the shock, and ultimately into the voids with a maximum extent similar to the final mass-weighted mean shock radius.

Klessen", "Volker Bromm"], "summary": "We investigate the properties of the first galaxies at z > 10 with highly resolved numerical simulations, starting from cosmological initial conditions and taking into account all relevant primordial chemistry and cooling. A first galaxy is characterized by the onset of atomic hydrogen cooling, once the virial temperature exceeds 10^4 K, and its ability to retain photoheated gas. We follow the complex accretion and star formation history of a 5*10^7 M_sun system by means of a detailed merger tree and derive an upper limit on the number of Population III (Pop III) stars formed prior to its assembly. We investigate the thermal and chemical evolution of infalling gas and find that partial ionization at temperatures > 10^4 K catalyses the formation of H2 and hydrogen deuteride, allowing the gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Depending on the strength of radiative and chemical feedback, primordial star formation might be dominated by intermediate-mass Pop III stars formed during the assembly of the first galaxies. Accretion on to the nascent galaxy begins with hot accretion, where gas is accreted directly from the intergalactic medium and shock-heated to the virial temperature, but is quickly accompanied by a phase of cold accretion, where the gas cools in filaments before flowing into the parent halo with high velocities. The latter drives supersonic turbulence at the centre of the galaxy and could lead to very efficient chemical mixing. The onset of turbulence in the first galaxies thus likely marks the transition to Pop II star formation.", "published": "2008-03-14T20:01:05+00:00", "updated": "2009-10-20T13:39:46+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2237v5", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13326.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13326.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2237v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2237v5"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The cluster was originally discovered using a modified red-sequence method and was also detected in follow-up Chandra data as extended X-ray source. Optical and near-infrared imaging data alone allow us to show that the detection of JKCS041 is as secure, even in absence of the X-ray data. We investigate the possibility that JKCS041 is not a discrete galaxy cluster at z=1.9, and find other explanations to be unlikely. The X-ray detection and statistical arguments rule out the hypothesis that JKCS041 is actually a blend of groups along the line of sight, and we find that the X-ray emitting gas is too hot and dense to be a filament projected along the line of sight. The cluster has an X-ray core radius of 36.6 arcsec (about 300 kpc), an X-ray temperature of 7.4 keV, a bolometric X-ray luminosity within R500 of 7.6 10^44 erg/s, an estimated mass of M500=2.9 10^14 Msol, the latter derived under the usual (and strong) assumptions. The cluster is composed of 16.4 galaxies within 1.5 arcmin (750 kpc) brighter than K~20.7 mag. The high redshift of JKCS041 is determined from the detection colour, from the detection of the cluster in a galaxy sample formed by z_phot>1.6 galaxies and from a photometric redshift based on 11-band spectral energy distribution fitting. By means of the latter we find the cluster redshift to be 1.84<z<2.12 at 68 % confidence. Therefore, JKCS041 is a cluster of galaxies at z=1.9 with deep potential well, making it the most distant cluster with extended X-ray emission known.", "published": "2008-12-09T14:21:01+00:00", "updated": "2009-10-19T08:13:12+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1699v2", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200912299", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200912299", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1699v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1699v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

In this model, the X-ray-emitting regions of these pulsars are near their spin axes but move. This is to be expected if the magnetic poles of these stars are close to their spin axes, so that accreting gas is channeled there. As the accretion rate and the structure of the inner disk vary, gas is channeled along different field lines to different locations on the stellar surface, causing the X-ray-emitting areas to move. We show that this \"nearly aligned moving spot model\" can explain many properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, including their generally low oscillation amplitudes and nearly sinusoidal waveforms; the variability of their pulse amplitudes, shapes, and phases; the correlations in this variability; and the similarity of the accretion- and nuclear-powered pulse shapes and phases in some.

The modeling results show that most of these luminous red galaxies (LRGs) are central galaxies residing in massive halos of typical mass M ~ a few times 10^13 to 10^14 Msun/h, while a few percent of them have to be satellites within halos in order to produce the strong auto-correlations exhibited on smaller scales. The mean luminosity Lc of central LRGs increases with the host halo mass, with a rough scaling relation of Lc \\propto M^0.5. The halo mass required to host on average one satellite LRG above a luminosity threshold is found to be about 10 times higher than that required to host a central LRG above the same threshold. We find that in massive halos the distribution of L* galaxies roughly follows that of the dark matter and their mean occupation number scales with halo mass as M^1.5. The HOD modeling results also allows for an intuitive understanding of the scale-dependent luminosity dependence of the cross-correlation between LRGs and L_* galaxies. Constraints on the LRG HOD provide tests to models of formation and evolution of massive galaxies, and they are also useful for cosmological parameter investigations.

We argue that redshift-space distortion measurements will help to determine the physics behind the cosmic acceleration, testing whether it is related to dark energy or modified gravity, and will provide an opportunity to test possible dark energy clumping or coupling between dark energy and dark matter. If we can measure galaxy bias in addition, simultaneous measurement of both the overdensity and velocity fields can be used to test the validity of equivalence principle, through the continuity equation.", "published": "2008-07-06T19:22:44+00:00", "updated": "2009-10-06T14:26:26+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0810v2", "doi": "10.1088/1475-7516/2009/10/004", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/10/004", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0810v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0810v2"], "journal_reference": "JCAP 0910:004,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Here we show that this \"nearly aligned moving spot model\" may also explain the intermittent accretion-powered pulsations that have been detected in three weakly magnetic accreting neutron stars. We show that movement of the emitting area from very close to the spin axis to about 10 degrees away can increase the fractional rms amplitude from less than about 0.5 percent, which is usually undetectable with current instruments, to a few percent, which is easily detectable. The second harmonic of the spin frequency usually would not be detected, in agreement with observations. The model produces intermittently detectable oscillations for a range of emitting area sizes and beaming patterns, stellar masses and radii, and viewing directions. Intermittent oscillations are more likely in stars that are more compact. In addition to explaining the sudden appearance of accretion-powered millisecond oscillations in some neutron stars with millisecond spin periods, the model explains why accretion-powered millisecond oscillations are relatively rare and predicts that the persistent accretion-powered millisecond oscillations of other stars may become undetectable for brief intervals. It suggests why millisecond oscillations are frequently detected during the X-ray bursts of some neutron stars but not others and suggests mechanisms that could explain the occasional temporal association of intermittent accretion-powered oscillations with thermonuclear X-ray bursts.", "published": "2008-09-24T18:16:01+00:00", "updated": "2009-10-05T17:25:59+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4016v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/705/1/L36", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/705/1/L36", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4016v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4016v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.705:L36-L39,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Four different grid codes (ENZO, FLASH, TVD, ZEUS) and three different SPH codes (GADGET, PHANTOM, VINE) are compared. We additionally analysed two calculations denoted as PHANTOM A and PHANTOM B using two different implementations of artificial viscosity. Our analysis indicates that grid codes tend to be less dissipative than SPH codes, though details of the techniques used can make large differences in both cases. For example, the Morris & Monaghan viscosity implementation for SPH results in less dissipation (PHANTOM B and VINE versus GADGET and PHANTOM A). For grid codes, using a smaller diffusion parameter leads to less dissipation, but results in a larger bottleneck effect (our ENZO versus FLASH runs). As a general result, we find that by using a similar number of resolution elements N for each spatial direction means that all codes (both grid-based and particle-based) show encouraging similarity of all statistical quantities for isotropic supersonic turbulence on spatial scales k<N/32 (all scales resolved by more than 32 grid cells), while scales smaller than that are significantly affected by the specific implementation of the algorithm for solving the equations of hydrodynamics.

Free IFT reproduces the well known Wiener-filter theory. Interacting IFT can be diagrammatically expanded, for which we provide the Feynman rules in position-, Fourier-, and spherical harmonics space, and the Boltzmann-Shannon information measure. The theory should be applicable in many fields. However, here, two cosmological signal recovery problems are discussed in their IFT-formulation. 1) Reconstruction of the cosmic large-scale structure matter distribution from discrete galaxy counts in incomplete galaxy surveys within a simple model of galaxy formation. We show that a Gaussian signal, which should resemble the initial density perturbations of the Universe, observed with a strongly non-linear, incomplete and Poissonian-noise affected response, as the processes of structure and galaxy formation and observations provide, can be reconstructed thanks to the virtue of a response-renormalization flow equation. 2) We design a filter to detect local non-linearities in the cosmic microwave background, which are predicted from some Early-Universe inflationary scenarios, and expected due to measurement imperfections.

We focus here on a limitation of such models as treated so far in the literature: the force, as it has been specified, is well defined in infinite point distributions only if there is a centre of symmetry (i.e. the definition requires explicitly the breaking of statistical translational invariance). The problem arises because naive background subtraction (due to expansion, or by \"Jeans' swindle\" for the static case), applied as in three dimensions, leaves an unregulated contribution to the force due to surface mass fluctuations. Following a discussion by Kiessling, we show that the problem may be resolved by defining the force in infinite point distributions as the limit of an exponentially screened pair interaction. We show that this prescription gives a well defined (finite) force acting on particles in a class of perturbed infinite lattices, which are the point processes relevant to cosmological N-body simulations. For identical particles the dynamics of the simplest toy model is equivalent to that of an infinite set of points with inverted harmonic oscillator potentials which bounce elastically when they collide. We discuss previous results in the literature, and present new results for the specific case of this simplest (static) model starting from \"shuffled lattice\" initial conditions.

It is found that the observed ages and luminosities of the brightest clusters in spiral discs can be reproduced if the ICMF is a Schechter function with a cut-off mass (Mc) of a few times 10^5 Msun and disruption of optically visible clusters is dominated by relatively slow secular evolution. A direct Schechter function fit to the combined cluster MF for all spirals in the sample studied here yields Mc = (2.1+/-0.4)x10^5 Msun. The MFs in cluster-poor and cluster-rich spirals are statistically indistinguishable. An Mc=2.1x10^5 Msun Schechter function also fits the MF of young clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. If the same ICMF applies in the Milky Way, a bound cluster with M>10^5 Msun will form about once every 10 Myr, while an M>10^6 Msun cluster will form only once every 50 Gyr. Luminosity functions (LFs) of model cluster populations drawn from an Mc=2.1x10^5 Msun Schechter ICMF generally agree with LFs observed in spiral galaxies. It is thus concluded that the ICMF in present-day spiral discs can be modelled as a Schechter function with Mc = 200,000 Msun. However, the presence of significant numbers of M>10^6 Msun (and even M>10^7 Msun) clusters in some starburst galaxies makes it unlikely that the Mc value derived for spirals is universal.

Salati", "R. Taillet", "."], "summary": "Secondary positrons are produced by spallation of cosmic rays within the interstellar gas. Measurements have been typically expressed in terms of the positron fraction, which exhibits an increase above 10 GeV. Many scenarios have been proposed to explain this feature, among them some additional primary positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in the Galaxy. The PAMELA satellite has provided high quality data that has enabled high accuracy statistical analyses to be made, showing that the increase in the positron fraction extends up to about 100 GeV. It is therefore of paramount importance to constrain theoretically the expected secondary positron flux to interpret the observations in an accurate way. We find the secondary positron flux to be reproduced well by the available observations, and to have theoretical uncertainties that we quantify to be as large as about one order of magnitude. We also discuss the positron fraction issue and find that our predictions may be consistent with the data taken before PAMELA. For PAMELA data, we find that an excess is probably present after considering uncertainties in the positron flux, although its amplitude depends strongly on the assumptions made in relation to the electron flux.

Our focus is on the non-linear dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse, and the assembly of positive energy material below it. To this end, we perform time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial symmetry. These generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium between n, p and alpha. The heating rate is freely tunable, as is the starting radius of the shock relative to the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion in spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an overstable mode, which may be viewed as the L=0 version of the `Standing Accretion Shock Instability'. In 2D simulations, non-spherical deformations of the shock are driven by plumes of material with positive Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside the zone of strong neutrino heating. The non-spherical modes of the shock reach a large amplitude only when the heating rate is also high enough to excite convection below the shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock relative to the recombination radius. Weaker heating is required to drive an explosion in 2D than in 1D, but the difference also depends on the size of the shock. Forcing the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into n and p below the shock only causes a slight increase in the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts out at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or some other mechanism) must play a significant role in pushing the shock far enough out that recombination heating takes over.", "published": "2008-12-30T20:13:32+00:00", "updated": "2009-09-20T17:40:01+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4574v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/703/2/1464", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/703/2/1464", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4574v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4574v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.703:1464-1485,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

ULAS J1319+0950 was, in fact, registered by SDSS as a faint source with z_AB = 20.1 +/- 0.1, just below the signal--to--noise ratio limit of the SDSS high-redshift quasar survey. The faint z-band magnitude is a consequence of the weak Ly alpha/N V emission line, which has a rest-frame equivalent width of only ~20 A and provides only a small boost to the z-band flux. Nevertheless, there is no evidence from this UKIDSS-based search for a significant population of high-redshift quasars with weak emission lines. The Ly alpha optical depth to ULAS J1319+0950 is consistent with that measured towards similarly distant SDSS quasars, implying that results from optical- and NIR-selected quasars may be combined. Also presented is a new NIR-spectrum of the previously discovered UKIDSS quasar ULAS J020332.38+001229.2, which reveals the object to be a broad absorption line quasar.

The overbearing degree of compression achieved shortly after pericenter leads to the production of strong shocks which largely homogenize the temperature profile of the star, resulting in surface temperatures comparable to the initial temperature of the star's core.

We first suggest the independence of the two relations although they have been considered similar and dependent. From this viewpoint, we compare constraints on cosmological parameters, $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$, from the Yonetoku and Amati relations calibrated by low-redshift GRBs with $z < 1.8$. We found that they are different in 1-$\\sigma$ level, although they are still consistent in 2-$\\sigma$ level.

However, this seems to suggest a rethink of our standard notions of cosmological evolution after the end of inflation and before the beginning of BBN. We argue that within classes of realistic string compactifications, there generically exists a light modulus with a mass comparable to that of the gravitino which generates a large late-time entropy when it decays. Therefore, all known mechanisms of generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the literature have to take this fact into account. In this work, we find that it is still possible to naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe as well as light left-handed neutrino masses from a period of Affleck-Dine(AD) leptogenesis shortly after the end of inflation, in classes of realistic string constructions with a minimal extension of the MSSM below the unification scale (consisting only of right-handed neutrinos) and satisfying certain microscopic criteria described in the text. The consequences are as follows. The lightest left-handed neutrino is required to be virtually massless. The moduli (gravitino) problem can be naturally solved in this framework both within gravity and gauge mediation. The observed upper bound on the relic abundance constrains the moduli-matter and moduli-gravitino couplings since the DM is produced non-thermally within this framework. Finally, although not a definite prediction, the framework naturally allows a light right-handed neutrino and sneutrinos around the electroweak scale which could have important implications for DM as well as the LHC.", "published": "2008-09-15T20:13:20+00:00", "updated": "2009-09-16T17:38:40+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2610v3", "doi": "10.1088/1126-6708/2009/05/083", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1126-6708/2009/05/083", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2610v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2610v3"], "journal_reference": "JHEP 0905:083,2009", "primary_category": "hep-ph", "categories": ["hep-ph", "astro-ph", "hep-th"]}

To calculate the modified observable distance-redshift relations, we introduce a generalized Dyer-Roeder method that allows for two crucial physical properties of the universe: inhomogeneities in the expansion rate and the growth of the nonlinear structures. By treating the transition redshift to the void-dominated era as a free parameter, we find a phenomenological fit to the observations from the CMB anisotropy, the position of the baryon oscillation peak, the magnitude-redshift relations of type Ia supernovae, the local Hubble flow and the nucleosynthesis, resulting in a concordant model of the universe with 90% dark matter, 10% baryons, no dark energy, 15 Gyr as the age of the universe and a natural value for the transition redshift z_0=0.35. Unlike a large local void, the model respects the cosmological principle, further offering an explanation for the late onset of the perceived acceleration as a consequence of the forming nonlinear structures. Additional tests, such as quantitative predictions for angular deviations due to an anisotropic void distribution and a theoretical derivation of the model, can vindicate or falsify the interpretation that light propagation in voids is responsible for the perceived acceleration.", "published": "2007-11-27T20:47:32+00:00", "updated": "2009-09-16T15:19:53+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.4264v3", "doi": "10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.4264v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.4264v3"], "journal_reference": "Gen.Rel.Grav.42:567-599,2010", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Binary systems with similar periods about the Galactic centre could be affected on even less eccentric orbits.

An effort is made to show the connections behind the occasionally diverging nomenclature in the literature, to contrast the different points of view about basic mechanisms, and to highlight concepts for interpreting the results of numerical simulations. The role of dissipation of magnetic energy in accelerating the flow is discussed, and its importance for explaining high Lorentz factors. The collimation of jets to the observed narrow angles is discussed, including a critical discussion of the role of `hoop stress'. The transition between disk and outflow is one of the least understood parts of the magnetic theory; its role in setting the mass flux in the wind, in possible modulations of the mass flux, and the uncertainties in treating it realistically are discussed. Current views on most of these problems are still strongly influenced by the restriction to 2 dimensions (axisymmetry) in previous analytical and numerical work; 3-D effects likely to be important are suggested.

Bryan", "Zoltan Haiman"], "summary": "UV radiation from early astrophysical sources could have a large impact on subsequent star formation in nearby protogalaxies. Here we study the radiative feedback from the first, short-lived stars using hydrodynamical simulations with transient UV backgrounds (UVBs) and persistent Lyman-Werner backgrounds (LWBs) of varying intensity. We extend our prior work in Mesinger et al. (2006), by studying a more typical region whose proto-galaxies form at lower redshifts, z~13-20, in the epoch likely preceding the bulk of reionization. We confirm our previous results that feedback in the relic HII regions resulting from such transient radiation, is itself transient. Feedback effects dwindle away after ~30% of the Hubble time, and the same critical specific intensity of J_UV~0.1 x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr separates positive and negative feedback regimes. Additionally, we discover a second episode of eventual positive feedback in halos which have not yet collapsed when their progenitor regions were exposed to the transient UVB. This eventual positive feedback appears in all runs, regardless of the strength of the UVB. However, this feedback regime is very sensitive to the presence of Lyman-Werner radiation, and notable effects disappear under fairly modest background intensities of J_LW>10^{-3} x 10^{-21} ergs/s/cm^2/Hz/sr. We conclude that UV radiative feedback in relic HII regions, although a complicated process, seems unlikely to have a major impact on the progress of cosmological reionization, provided that present estimates of the lifetime and luminosity of a PopIII star are accurate. More likely is that the build-up of the LWB ultimately governs the feedback strength until a persistent UV background can be established.

In order to study perturbations with amplitudes extremely close to the supposed critical limit, we have modified our previous computer code with the introduction of an adaptive mesh refinement scheme. This has allowed us to follow black hole formation from perturbations whose amplitudes are up to eight orders of magnitude closer to the threshold than we could do before. We find that scaling-law behaviour continues down to the smallest black hole masses that we are able to follow and we see no evidence of shock production such as has been reported in some previous studies and which led there to a breaking of the scaling-law behaviour at small black-hole masses.

Unlike past similar attempts our approach is a purely kinematical application of the conformal symmetry to the Universe, through a critical reanalysis of fundamental astrophysical observations, such as the cosmological redshift and others. As a result of this novel approach we obtain a closed-form expression for the cosmic scale factor R(t) and a revised interpretation of the space-time coordinates usually employed in cosmology. New fundamental cosmological parameters are introduced and evaluated. This emerging new cosmology does not seem to possess any of the controversial features of the current standard model, such as the presence of dark matter, dark energy or of a cosmological constant, the existence of the horizon problem or of an inflationary phase. Comparing our results with current conformal cosmologies in the literature, we note that our kinematic cosmology is equivalent to conformal gravity with a cosmological constant at late (or early) cosmological times. The cosmic scale factor and the evolution of the Universe are described in terms of several dimensionless quantities, among which a new cosmological variable delta emerges as a natural cosmic time. The mathematical connections between all these quantities are described in details and a relationship is established with the original kinematic cosmology by L. Infeld and A. Schild.

The effect is due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the interference of quantum coherent states. The theory is constructed as follows: Faddeev-Popov-De Witt gauged path integral -> factorization of classical and quantum variables -> transition to the 1-loop approximation -> choice of ghost sector, satisfying 1-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell. The Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain for the spectral function of gravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to build a theory of gravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact solutions of the equations that describe virtual graviton and ghost condensates as well as condensates of instanton fluctuations. Exact solutions correspond to various condensates with different graviton-ghost compositions. The formalism of the BBGKY chain takes into account the contribution of non-relativistic matter in the formation of a common self-consistent gravitational field. It is shown that the era of non-relativistic matter dominance must be replaced by an era of dominance of graviton-ghost condensate. Pre-asymptotic state of DE is a condensate of virtual gravitons and ghosts with a constant conformal wavelength. The asymptotic state predicted by the theory is a graviton-ghost condensate of constant physical wavelength in the De Sitter space. Such DE phenomenon is presented in the form of the model that interpolates the exact solutions of equations of 1-loop QG. Processing of observational DE data extracted from the Hubble diagram for supernovae SNIa suggests that the graviton-ghost condensate is an adequate variable component of DE.", "published": "2008-11-27T08:34:37+00:00", "updated": "2009-09-07T07:57:14+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.4484v2", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4484v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.4484v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "gr-qc", "categories": ["gr-qc", "astro-ph", "hep-ph", "hep-th"]}

The SDSS data on galaxy clustering can also be fitted if there is a small component of hot dark matter in the form of 0.5 eV mass neutrinos. We show however that if the primordial fluctuations are gaussian, the expected variance of the Hubble parameter and the matter density are far too small to allow such a large local void. Nevertheless many such large voids have been identified in the SDSS LRG survey in a search for the late-ISW effect due to dark energy. The observed CMB temperature decrements imply that they are nearly empty, thus these real voids too are in gross conflict with the concordance LCDM model.

We have spectroscopically identified large samples of K+A galaxies both in the SDSS at z~0.1 and in the DEEP2 survey at z~0.8, using a robust selection method based on a cut in Hbeta emission rather than the more problematic [OII] 3727. Based on measurements of the overdensity of galaxies around each object, we find that K+A galaxies brighter than 0.4L*_B at low-z have a similar, statistically indistinguishable environment distribution as blue galaxies, preferring underdense environments, but dramatically different from that of red galaxies. However, at higher-z, the environment distribution of K+A galaxies is more similar to red galaxies than to blue galaxies. We conclude that the quenching of star formation and the build-up of the red sequence through the K+A phase is happening in relatively overdense environments at z~1 but in relatively underdense environments at z~0. Although the relative environments where quenching occurs are decreasing with time, the corresponding absolute environment may have stayed the same along with the quenching mechanisms, because the mean absolute environments of all galaxies has to grow with time. In addition, we do not find any significant dependence on luminosity in the environment distribution of K+As. The existence of a large K+A population in the field at both redshifts indicates that cluster-specific mechanisms cannot be the dominant route by which these galaxies are formed. We also demonstrates that studying K+A-environment relations by measuring the K+A fraction in different environments is highly non-robust.

This includes FRW universes which are arbitrarily close to the Milne Universe, which is empty, and to the de Sitter universe. Hence the postulate formulated by E. Mach about the physical cause for the time-evolution of the axis directions of inertial frames is shown to hold in cosmological General Relativity for linear perturbations. The time-evolution of axis directions of local inertial frames (relative to given local fiducial axes) is given experimentally by the precession angular velocity of gyroscopes, which in turn is given by the operational definition of the gravitomagnetic field. The gravitomagnetic field is caused by cosmological energy currents via the momentum constraint. This equation for cosmological gravitomagnetism is analogous to Ampere's law, but it holds also for time-dependent situtations. In the solution for an open universe the 1/r^2-force of Ampere is replaced by a Yukawa force which is of identical form for FRW backgrounds with $K = (-1, 0).$ The scale of the exponential cutoff is the H-dot radius, where H is the Hubble rate, and dot is the derivative with respect to cosmic time.

The difficulties stem from the existence of a solid angle degeneracy, as revealed by a full exploration of the likelihood, although this can be masked if a simple best-fit approach is used. Conversely, this degeneracy can be broken if a Bayesian approach is adopted, as it is then possible to utilise the prior information on the surface gravities of WDs implied by spectroscopic fitting. The benefits of such an approach are particularly strong when applied to outliers, such as the candidate halo and ultra-cool WDs identified by Vidrih et al. (2007).

This concerns objects that are described by a linear equation of state $P=q\\epsilon$ so that the pressure is proportional to the energy density. In the Newtonian limit $q\\to 0$, this returns the classical isothermal equation of state. We consider specifically a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/3), the core of neutron stars (q=1/3) and a gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field (q=1). We study how the thermodynamical parameters scale with the size of the object and find unusual behaviours due to the non-extensivity of the system. We compare these scaling laws with the area scaling of the black hole entropy. We also determine the domain of validity of these scaling laws by calculating the critical radius above which relativistic stars described by a linear equation of state become dynamically unstable. For photon stars, we show that the criteria of dynamical and thermodynamical stability coincide. Considering finite spheres, we find that the mass and entropy as a function of the central density present damped oscillations. We give the critical value of the central density, corresponding to the first mass peak, above which the series of equilibria becomes unstable. Finally, we extend our results to d-dimensional spheres. We show that the oscillations of mass versus central density disappear above a critical dimension d_{crit}(q). For Newtonian isothermal stars (q=0) we recover the critical dimension d_{crit}=10. For the stiffest stars (q=1) we find d_{crit}=9 and for a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/d) we find d_{crit}=9.96404372... very close to 10.

In this paper we develop a non-parametric method for extracting information about the perturbative growth factor from data pertaining to the luminosity or angular size distances. A comparison of the reconstructed density contrast with observations of large scale structure and gravitational lensing can help distinguish DE models such as the cosmological constant and quintessence from models based on modified gravity theories as well as models in which DE and DM are either unified, or interact directly. We show that for current SNe data, the linear growth factor at z = 0.3 can be constrained to 5%, and the linear growth rate to 6%. With future SNe data, such as expected from the JDEM mission, we may be able to constrain the growth factor to 2-3% and the growth rate to 3-4% at z = 0.3 with this unbiased, model-independent reconstruction method. For future BAO data which would deliver measurements of both the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter, it should be possible to constrain the growth factor at z = 2.5 to 9%.

To test a category of dark energy models, we suggest introducing a characteristic Q(z) that in general varies with the redshift z but in those models plays the role of a (constant) distinct parameter. Then, by reconstructing dQ(z)/dz from observational data and comparing it with zero we can assess the consistency between data and the models under consideration. For a category of models that passes the test, we can further constrain the distinct parameter of those models by reconstructing Q(z) from data. For demonstration, in this paper we concentrate on quintessence. In particular we examine the exponential potential and the power-law potential via a widely used parametrization of the dark energy equation of state, w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z), for data analysis. This method of the consistency test is particularly efficient because for all models we invoke the constraint of only a single parameter space that by choice can be easily accessed. The general principle of our approach is not limited to dark energy. It may also be applied to the testing of various cosmological models and even the models in other fields beyond the scope of cosmology.", "published": "2008-03-31T17:24:42+00:00", "updated": "2009-08-31T13:11:08+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.4504v3", "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/11/7/073029", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/11/7/073029", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4504v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.4504v3"], "journal_reference": "New J.Phys.11:073029,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Lensed galaxies behind the massive clusters A1689, A1835 and AC114 were observed for a total of 20 hours split into 2, 3 and 4 epochs respectively, separated by approximately one month to a limiting magnitude J<24 (Vega). Image subtractions including another 20 hours worth of archival ISAAC/VLT data were used to search for transients with lightcurve properties consistent with redshifted supernovae, both in the new and reference data. The feasibility of finding lensed supernovae in our survey was investigated using synthetic lightcurves of supernovae and several models of the volumetric Type Ia and core-collapse supernova rates as a function of redshift. We also estimate the number of supernova discoveries expected from the inferred star formation rate in the observed galaxies. The methods consistently predict a Poisson mean value for the expected number of SNe in the survey between N_SN=0.8 and 1.6 for all supernova types, evenly distributed between core collapse and Type Ia SN.

For fixed power density in the far field, what is the cost-optimum interstellar Beacon system? Experience shows an optimum tradeoff, depending on transmission frequency and on antenna size and power. This emerges by minimizing the cost of producing a desired effective isotropic radiated power, which in turn determines the maximum range of detectability of a transmitted signal. We derive general relations for cost-optimal aperture and power. For linear dependence of capital cost on transmitter power and antenna area, minimum capital cost occurs when the cost is equally divided between antenna gain and radiated power. For non-linear power law dependence a similar simple division occurs. This is validated in cost data for many systems; industry uses this cost optimum as a rule-of-thumb. Costs of pulsed cost-efficient transmitters are estimated from these relations using current cost parameters ($/W, $/m2) as a basis. Galactic-scale Beacons demand effective isotropic radiated power >1017 W, emitted powers are >1 GW, with antenna areas > km2. We show the scaling and give examples of such Beacons. Thrifty beacon systems would be large and costly, have narrow searchlight beams and short dwell times when the Beacon would be seen by an alien oberver at target areas in the sky. They may revisit an area infrequently and will likely transmit at higher microwave frequencies, ~10 GHz. The natural corridor to broadcast is along the galactic spiral radius or along the spiral galactic arm we are in.

The recent $e^+$ fraction spectrum from the Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) shows a sharp rise up to 100 GeV. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has found a significant hardening of the e+e- cosmic ray spectrum above 100 GeV, with a break, confirmed by HESS at around 1 TeV. The Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter (ATIC) has also detected detected a similar excess, falling back to the expected spectrum at 1 TeV and above. Excess microwaves towards the galactic center in the WMAP data are consistent with hard synchrotron radiation from a population of 10-100 GeV e+- (the WMAP ``Haze''). We argue that dark matter annihilations can provide a consistent explanation of all of these data, focusing on dominantly leptonic modes, either directly or through a new light boson. Normalizing the signal to the highest energy evidence (Fermi and HESS), we find that similar cross sections provide good fits to PAMELA and the Haze, and that both the required cross section and annihilation modes are achievable in models with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. These models naturally predict significant production of gamma rays in the galactic center via a variety of mechanisms.

Deriving accurate frequencies, amplitudes, and mode lifetimes from stochastically driven pulsation is challenging, more so, if one demands that realistic error estimates be given for all model fitting parameters. As has been shown by other authors, the traditional method of fitting Lorentzian profiles to the power spectrum of time-resolved photometric or spectroscopic data via the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) procedure delivers good approximations for these quantities. We, however, show that a conservative Bayesian approach allows one to treat the detection of modes with minimal assumptions (i.e., about the existence and identity of the modes). Methods. We derive a conservative Bayesian treatment for the probability of Lorentzian profiles being present in a power spectrum and describe an efficient implementation that evaluates the probability density distribution of parameters by using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. Results. Potentially superior to \"best-fit\" procedure like MLE, which only provides formal uncertainties, our method samples and approximates the actual probability distributions for all parameters involved. Moreover, it avoids shortcomings that make the MLE treatment susceptible to the built-in assumptions of a model that is fitted to the data.

The non-uniqueness of the rotation axis encodes the extra dimension. This geometrical interpretation becomes evident on writing KS transforms in quaternion form, which also helps derive concise expressions for regularized equations of motion.", "published": "2008-03-31T11:57:03+00:00", "updated": "2009-08-21T15:28:21+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.4441v3", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15437.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15437.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4441v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.4441v3"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We show the importance of resonant shocks and resonant torques with the host halo to satellite heating. A resonant shock (torque) couples the radial (tangential) motion of a satellite in its orbit to its phase space. For a satellite on a circular orbit, an ILR-like resonance dominates the heating and this heating results in continuous satellite mass loss. We estimate the requirements for simulations to achieve these dynamics using perturbation theory. Both resonant shocks and resonant torques affect satellites on eccentric orbits. We demonstrate that satellite mass loss is an outside-in process in energy space; a satellite's stars and gas are thus protected by their own halo against tidal stripping. We simulate the evolution of a halo similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in our Galactic dark matter halo and conclude that the LMC stars have not yet been stripped.

On the surface of the object, we find that the extreme attractivity of the gravity is accompanied with an extremely high internal, heat energy. This internal energy implies a correspondingly high pressure, the gradient of which has such a behavior that it can compete with the gravity.

We also reconsider the role of Population III stars (PopIII) in light of cosmological and stellar evolution constraints. While this input may be needed for reionization, we show that it is essential in order to account for cosmic chemical evolution in the early Universe.

Our most important results show that the nucleosynthetic yields of PopIII stars lead to abundance patterns in agreement with those observed in extremely metal-poor stars.

Here we present simultaneous optical (BVRI) and X-ray (RXTE PCA) data from the day of the VHE detection and discuss the implications of the snap-shot spectral energy distribution for jet models of blazars. A one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton origin of the entire SED, including the VHE gamma-ray emission can be ruled out. The VHE emission could, in principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation (e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would require either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an unrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140. In addition, such a model fails to reproduce the observed X-ray flux. This as well as the lack of correlated variability in the optical with the VHE gamma-ray emission and the substantial gamma-gamma opacity of the BLR radiation field to VHE gamma-rays suggests a multi-zone model. In particular, an SSC model with an emission region far outside the BLR reproduces the simultaneous X-ray -- VHE gamma-ray spectrum of 3C279. Alternatively, a hadronic model is capable of reproducing the observed SED of 3C279 reasonably well.

We suggest that it is natural to expect that the imprint on the primordial power spectrum of a preferred spatial direction is approximately scale-invariant, and examine a simple model in which this is true.", "published": "2007-01-11T23:47:40+00:00", "updated": "2009-08-10T19:42:39+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0701357v5", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.75.083502 10.1103/PhysRevD.80.069901", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.75.083502", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.069901", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701357v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0701357v5"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rev.D75:083502,2007; Erratum-ibid.D80:069901,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc", "hep-ph", "hep-th"]}

Both quintessential fields are studied for the same cosmological model. The systems of evolutionary equations for gauge-invariant perturbations of metrics, matter and quintessence have been analysed analyticaly for the early stage of the Universe life and numerically up to the present epoch. It is shown that amplitudes of the adiabatic matter density perturbations grow like in $\\Lambda$CDM-model but time dependences of amplitudes of the quintessence perturbations are more varied: gauge-invariant variables $D_g^{(Q)}$ and $D_s^{(Q)}$ decay from initial constant value after entering the particle horizon while $D^{(Q)}$ and $V^{(Q)}$ grow at the early stage before entering the horizon and decay after that -- in the quintessence-dominated epoch, when gravitational potential starts to decay -- so, that at the current epoch they are approximately two orders lower than matter ones at the supercluster scale. Therefore, at the subhorizon scales the quintessential scalar fields are smoothed out while the matter clusters. It is also shown that both quintessential scalar fields suppress the growth of matter density perturbations and the amplitude of gravitational potential. In these QCDM-models -- unlike $\\Lambda$CDM ones -- such suppression is scale dependent and more visible for the quintessence with $c^2_a=0$.", "published": "2008-08-15T19:30:59+00:00", "updated": "2009-08-10T14:12:18+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2098v4", "doi": null, "links": ["http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2098v4", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2098v4"], "journal_reference": "J.Phys.Stud.13:1902,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc", "hep-ph"]}

Unfortunately, along these approaches the interpretation and the physical meaning of the effective change of dimension at shorter scales is not clear. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we find that box-counting dimension in face of finite resolution of space-time (generally implied by quantum gravity) shows a simple way how both the qualitative and the quantitative features of this effect can be understood.

We argue that the diffuse, polarized emission from giant radio relics traces structure formation shock waves and illuminates the large-scale magnetic field. To show this, we model the population of shock-accelerated relativistic electrons in high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters and calculate the resulting radio synchrotron emission. We find that individual shock waves correspond to localized peaks in the radio surface brightness map which enables us to measure Mach numbers for these shocks. We show that the luminosities and number counts of the relics strongly depend on the magnetic field properties, the cluster mass and dynamical state. By suitably combining different cluster data, including Faraday rotation measures, we are able to constrain some macroscopic parameters of the plasma at the structure formation shocks, such as models of turbulence. We also predict upper limits for the properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium, such as its temperature and density. We predict that the current generation of radio telescopes (LOFAR, GMRT, MWA, LWA) have the potential to discover a substantially larger sample of radio relics, with multiple relics expected for each violently merging cluster.

Paper III will extend the current FK formalism to a higher order. Use of the FK equation of state is limited to physical conditions for which more than 90% of helium is ionized. This incudes the inner region of the Sun out to about .98 of the solar radius. Despite this limitation, in the parts of the Sun where it is applicable, the FK equation of state has the power to be more accurate than the equations of state currently used in solar modeling. The FK approach is especially suited to study physical effects such as Coulomb screening, bound states, the onset of recombination of fully ionized species, as well as diffraction and exchange effects. The localizing power of helioseismology allows a test of the FK equation of state.

Indeed, nowadays, relativistic effects have to be taken into account, and comparing a RMI model with a classical keplerian one helps to quantify such effects. LISA is a relevant example to use RMI. A precise orbit model for the LISA spacecraft is needed not only for the sake of satellite ephemerides but also to compute the photon flight time in laser links between spacecraft, required in LISA data pre-processing in order to reach the gravitational wave detection level. Relativistic effects in LISA orbit model needed to be considered and quantified. Using RMI, we show that the numerical classical model for LISA orbits in the gravitational field of a non-rotating spherical Sun without planets can be wrong, with respect to the numerical relativisitic version of the same model, by as much as about ten kilometers in radial distance during a year and up to about 60 kilometers in along track distance after a year... with consequences on estimated photon flight times.

We expect that pre-reionization fossils that evolved on the outskirts of the Milky Way or in isolation show a bimodal star formation history with 12 Gyr old and <10 Gyr old population of stars. Leo T fits with this scenario. Another prediction of the model is the possible existence of a population of gas rich minihalos that never formed stars.

Especially the question of how pick-up ions form their suprathermal tails, extending to far above their injection energies, still now is unsatistactorily answered. Though Fermi-2 velocity diffusion theories have revealed that such tails are populated, they nevertheless show that resulting population densities are much less than seen in observations showing power-laws with a velocity index of \"-5\". We first investigate here, whether or not observationally suggested power-laws can be the result of a quasi-equilibrium state between suprathermal ions and magnetohydrodynamic turbulences in energy exchange with eachother. We demonstrate that such an equilibrium cannot be established, since it would require too high pick-up ion pressures enforcing a shock-free deceleration of the solar wind. We furthermore show that Fermi-2 type energy diffusion in the outer heliosphere is too inefficient to determine the shape of the distribution function there. As we can show, however, power-laws beyond the injection threshold can be established, if the injection takes place at higher energies of the order of 100 keV. As we demonstrate here, such an injection is connected with modulated anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) particles at the lower end of their spectrum when they again start being convected outwards with the solar wind. Therefore, we refer to these particles as ACR-PUIs.

Far ultraviolet imaging was carried out with the Solar Blind Channel of the ACS on HST in the F122M (Lya on-line) and F140LP (continuum) filters. The resulting Lya images are the product of careful modeling of both the stellar and nebular continua, facilitated by supporting HST imaging in Ha and 5 continuum bands, combined with Starburst99 evolutionary synthesis models, and prescriptions for dust extinction on the continuum. In all, the resulting morphologies in Lya, Ha, and UV-continuum are qualitatively very different and we show that the bulk of Lya emerges in a diffuse component resulting from resonant scattering events. Lya escape fractions, computed from integrated Ha luminosities and recombination theory, are found never to exceed 14%. Internal dust extinction is estimated in each pixel and used to correct Lya fluxes. However, the extinction corrections are far too small (factors from 2.6 to infinity) to reconcile the global Lya luminosities with recombination theory. Surprisingly, when comparing the global equivalent widths of Lya and Ha, the two quantities appear anti-correlated, which may be due to the evolution of mechanical feedback. This calls for caution in the interpretation of Lya observations. The images presented have a physical resolution 3 orders of magnitude better than attainable at high-z from the ground with current instrumentation and our images may therefore serve as useful templates for comparing with observations and modeling of primeval galaxy formation.

We adopt the best-fitting cosmological parameters of WMAP (3rd- and 5th-year) and we consider non-Gaussianity of the local type parameterised by 8 different values of the non-linearity parameter F_NL. Building upon previous work based on the Gaussian case, we show that, expressed in terms of suitable variables, the mass function of friends-of-friends haloes is approximately universal (i.e. independent of redshift, cosmology, and matter transfer function) to good precision (nearly 10 per cent) also in non-Gaussian scenarios. We provide fitting formulae for the high-mass end (M>10^13 M_sol/h) of the universal mass function in terms of F_NL, and we also present a non-universal fit in terms of both F_NL and z to be used for applications requiring higher accuracy. In the Gaussian case, we extend our fit to a wider range of halo masses (M>2.4 x 10^10 M_sol/h) and we also provide a consistent fit of the linear halo bias. We show that, for realistic values of F_NL, the matter power-spectrum in non-Gaussian cosmologies departs from the Gaussian one by up to 2 per cent on the scales where the baryonic- oscillation features are imprinted on the 2-point statistics. We confirm the strong k-dependence of the halo bias on large scales (k<0.05 h Mpc^-1) which was already detected in previous studies. However, we find that commonly used parameterisations based on the peak-background split do not provide an accurate description of our simulations which present extra dependencies on the wavenumber, the non-linearity parameter and, possibly, the clustering strength.

Observations have been obtained in Lya and H-alpha (Ha) and 6 continuum filters between ~1500AA and the I-band. Previously (Hayes et al 2005) we demonstrated that the production of Lya line-only images in the SBC-only data-set is non-trivial and that supporting data is a requirement. We here develop various methods of continuum subtraction and assess their relative performance using a variety of spectral energy distributions (SED) as input. We conclude that simple assumptions about the behavior of the ultraviolet continuum consistently lead to results that are wildly erroneous, and determine that an SED fitting approach is essential. Moreover, a single component stellar or stellar+nebular spectrum is not always sufficient for realistic template SEDs and, in order to successfully recover the input observables, care must be taken to control contributions of nebular gas and underlying stellar populations. Independent measurements of the metallicity must first be obtained, but details of the initial mass function play only a small role. We identify the need to bin together pixels in our data to obtain signal-to-noise (S/N) of ~10 in each band before processing. At S/N=10 we can recover Lya fluxes accurate to ~30% for Lya lines with intrinsic equivalent width [W(Lya)] of 10AA. This accuracy improves to ~10% for W(Lya)=100AA.

The value of r0 is mainly related to the geometry of the array and is, therefore, considered as fixed independently of the shower energy or direction. We argue, however, that the dependence of r0 on energy and zenith angle is not negligible. Therefore, in the present work we propose a new characteristic distance, which we call ropt, specifically determined for each individual shower, with the objective of optimizing the energy reconstruction. This parameter may not only improve the energy determination, but also allow a more reliable reconstruction of the shape and position of rapidly varying spectral features. We show that the use of a specific ropt determined on a shower-to-shower basis, instead of using a fixed characteristic value, is of particular benefit in dealing with the energy reconstruction of events with saturated detectors, which are in general a large fraction of all the events detected by an array as energy increases. Furthermore, the ropt approach has the additional advantage of applying the same unified treatment for all detected events, regardless of whether they have saturated detectors or not.", "published": "2008-06-02T20:34:02+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-30T10:51:20+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.0388v2", "doi": "10.1016/j.nima.2009.07.031", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2009.07.031", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0388v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.0388v2"], "journal_reference": "Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A, 608,\n  454-463, 2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Here we construct analytic and Monte Carlo models to examine these fluctuations, including, for the first time, those during the reionization era itself. In agreement with detailed numerical simulations, our analytic model for the post-reionization Universe predicts order-of-magnitude fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate. Observations of the hardness ratio between HeII/HI show even larger fluctuations, which may be due to more complicated radiative transfer effects. During reionization, the fluctuations are even stronger. In contrast to hydrogen reionization, our model predicts that regions with strong HeII Lyman-alpha forest transmission should be reasonably common even during the beginning stages of reionization, because of strong illumination from bright quasars. Partly due to this, the mean ionizing background does not evolve strongly during and after helium reionization; it is roughly proportional to the filling fraction of HeIII regions. On the other hand, regions full of HeII and also \"fossil\" ionized regions that contain no (or few) active sources appear as strong IGM absorbers.

Methods: We use the test field method together with 3D numerical simulations of turbulent convection with shear and rotation to compute turbulent transport coefficients describing the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields in mean-field theory in the kinematic regime. 1D mean-field models are used with the derived turbulent transport coefficients to compare with direct simulations. Results: The alpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent diffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical velocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the wavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more complex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small alpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a function of shear. If the shear is large enough, this small alpha is able to excite a dynamo in the mean-field model. The coefficient responsible for driving the shear-current effect shows several sign changes as a function of depth but is also able to contribute to dynamo action in the mean-field model. The growth rates in these cases are well below those in direct simulations suggesting that an incoherent alpha-shear dynamo may also act in them. If both rotation and shear are present, the alpha-effect is more pronounced. The combination of the shear-current and Omega x J-effects is also stronger than in the case of shear only, but subdominant to the alpha-shear dynamo.

By varying the fraction of helicity of the turbulence the regeneration of poloidal fields via the helicity effect (corresponding to the \\alpha-effect) is regulated. The saturation level of the magnetic field in the numerical models is consistent with a linear dependence on the ratio of the fractional helicities of the small and large-scale fields, as predicted by a simple nonlinear mean-field model. As the magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) based on the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies is increased from 1 to 180, the cycle frequency of the large-scale field is found to decrease by a factor of about 6 in cases where the turbulence is fully helical.

We demonstrate that rotating convection in a Cartesian domain can drive a large-scale dynamo even in the absence of shear.

The simulation results are compared with one-dimensional mean-field dynamo models where turbulent transport coefficients, as determined using the test field method, are used. The reason for the absence of large-scale dynamo action in earlier studies is shown to be due to the rotation being too slow: whereas the alpha-effect can change sign, its magnitude stays approximately constant as a function of rotation, and the turbulent diffusivity decreases monotonically with increasing rotation. Only when rotation is rapid enough a large-scale dynamo can be excited. The one-dimensional mean-field model with dynamo coefficients from the test field results predicts reasonably well the dynamo excitation in the direct simulations. This result further validates the test field procedure and reinforces the interpretation that the observed dynamo is driven by a turbulent alpha-effect. This result demonstrates the existence of an alpha-effect and an alpha^2-dynamo with natural forcing.", "published": "2008-12-22T08:40:25+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-29T09:18:54+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3958v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/697/2/1153", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/697/2/1153", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3958v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3958v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.697:1153-1163,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We use Delaunay tessellations to define the velocity field, showing that the power spectra of velocity divergence and vorticity measured in this way are unbiased and have better noise properties than for standard interpolation methods that deal with mass weighted velocities. We show that high resolution simulations are required to recover the correct large-scale vorticity power spectrum, while poor resolution can spuriously amplify its amplitude by more than one order of magnitude. We measure the scalar and vector modes of the stress tensor induced by orbit crossing using an adaptive technique, showing that its vector modes lead, when input into the vorticity evolution equation, to the same vorticity power spectrum obtained from the Delaunay method. We incorporate orbit crossing corrections to the evolution of large scale density and velocity fields in perturbation theory by using the measured stress tensor modes. We find that at large scales (k~0.1 h/Mpc) vector modes have very little effect in the density power spectrum, while scalar modes (velocity dispersion) can induce percent level corrections at z=0, particularly in the velocity divergence power spectrum.

We perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellar medium (ISM) simulations in which supernova rates and vertical gas column densities are systematically varied based on the Schmidt-Kennicutt law. Our simulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow the hydrodynamic interactions among multiple supernovae that structure the ISM. At a given supernova rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed and velocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density, indicating that both thermal and turbulent pressures are nearly constant in the midplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. In contrast, across our four models having supernova rates that range from one to 512 times the Galactic supernova rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in the range 4-6 km/s. Hence, gas averaged over ~100 pc regions follows an effective equation of state that is close to isothermal. Simulated H I emission lines have widths of 10-18 km/s, comparable to observed values. In our highest supernova rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressure on large scales is >~4 times higher than the thermal pressure. We find a tight correlation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over ~100 pc regions in the midplane of each model, as well as across the four ISM models. We construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic arguments and explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ISM simulations.

Over two seasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the SPT at 95 GHz, 150 GHz, and 225 GHz. We report the four most significant SPT detections of SZ clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and, therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an SZ survey. The SZ clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5-sigma significance in the high-sensitivity 150 GHz SPT map. The SZ spectrum of these sources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locations in the 95 GHz SPT map and non-detections at those locations in the 225 GHz SPT map. Multiband optical images from the BCS survey demonstrate significant concentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the SZ detections. Photometric redshift estimates from the BCS data indicate that two of the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z >~ 0.8). One of the SZ detections was previously identified as a galaxy cluster using X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Potential RASS counterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two of the new discoveries.

All of them show complex patterns of spectral and temporal behavior. In this work, we discuss the physics behind the very high-energy emission in microquasars. In concrete, we focus on the microquasar Cygnus X-1, and also in the other two TeV binaries with detected extended outflows, LS 5039 and LS I +61 303, pointing out relevant aspects of the complex phenomena occurring in them. We conclude that the TeV emission is likely of leptonic origin, although hadrons cannot be discarded. In addition, efficient electromagnetic cascades can hardly develop since even relatively low magnetic fields suppress them. Also, the modeling of the radiation from some of the detected sources points to them as either extremely efficient accelerators, and/or having the TeV emitter at a distance from the compact object of about 10e12 cm. Finally, we point out that the role of a massive and hot stellar companion, due to its strong photon field and wind, cannot be neglected when trying to understand the behavior of microquasars at high and very high energies.

This is perceived to be a very important observational probe of dark energy. Future observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from the cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution hold the potential of probing the LSS over a large redshift range. We have investigated the possibility of detecting the ISW through cross-correlations between the CMBR anisotropies and redshifted 21-cm observations. Assuming that the HI traces the dark matter, we find that the ISW-HI cross-correlation angular power spectrum at an angular multipole l is proportional to the dark matter power spectrum evaluated at the comoving wave number l/r, where r is the comoving distance to the redshift from which the HI signal originated. The amplitude of the cross-correlation signal depends on parameters related to the HI distribution and the growth of cosmological perturbations. However the cross-correlation is extremely weak as compared to the CMBR anisotropies and the predicted HI signal. As a consequence the cross-correlation signal is smaller than the cosmic variance, and a statistically significant detection is not very likely.", "published": "2008-10-20T20:00:05+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-22T11:42:17+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3649v2", "doi": "10.1088/1475-7516/2009/08/019", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/08/019", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3649v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3649v2"], "journal_reference": "JCAP 0908:019,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

A substantial thin stellar disk grows rapidly following the last major merger and the present day properties of the final remnant are typical of early type spiral galaxies, with an i band B/D ~0.65, a disk scale length of 7.2 kpc, g-r = 0.5 mag, an HI line width (W_{20}/2) of 238 km/sec and total magnitude i = -22.4. The key ingredients for the formation of a dominant stellar disk component after a major merger are: i) substantial and rapid accretion of gas through cold flows followed at late times by cooling of gas from the hot phase, ii) supernova feedback that is able to partially suppress star formation during mergers and iii) relative fading of the spheroidal component. The gas fraction of the progenitors' disks does not exceed 25% at z<3, emphasizing that the continuous supply of gas from the local environment plays a major role in the regrowth of disks and in keeping the galaxies blue.

A control sample of regular, dynamically relaxed clusters, without radio halos but with comparable mean thermal temperatures and luminosities, shows no compelling evidence for similar components. Detailed X-ray spectral mapping reveals the complex thermodynamic states of the radio halo clusters. Our deepest observations, of the Bullet Cluster 1E 0657-56, demonstrate a spatial correlation between the strongest power-law X-ray emission, highest thermal pressure, and brightest 1.34GHz radio halo emission in this cluster. We confirm the presence of a shock front in the 1E 0657-56 and report the discovery of a new, large-scale shock front in Abell 2219. We explore possible origins for the power-law X-ray components. These include inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in the clusters; bremsstrahlung from supra-thermal electrons energized by Coulomb collisions with an energetic, nonthermal proton population; and synchrotron emission associated with ultra-relativistic electrons. Interestingly, we show that the power-law signatures may also be due to complex temperature and/or metallicity structure in clusters particularly in the presence of metallicity gradients.

We believe that this is indicative of MHD strong turbulence being less local than Kolmogorov turbulence.

We show that if their mass and charge fall in the range 100(q_X/e)^2< m_X < 10^8(q_X/e) TeV, then magnetic fields prevent particles in the halo from entering the galactic disk, while those initially trapped inside are accelerated through the Fermi mechanism and ejected within about 0.1-1 Gyrs.

Granot"], "summary": "Most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift satellite show an early rapid decay phase (RDP) in their X-ray lightcurve, which is usually a smooth continuation of the prompt gamma-ray emission, strongly suggesting that it is its tail. However, the mechanism behind it is still not clear. The most popular model for this RDP is High Latitude Emission (HLE). While HLE is expected in many models for the prompt GRB emission, such as the popular internal shocks model, there are models in which it is not expected, such as sporadic magnetic reconnection events. Therefore, testing whether the RDP is consistent with HLE can help distinguish between different prompt emission models. We address this question by modeling the prompt emission as the sum of its individual pulses with their HLE tails. Analytic expressions for the observed flux density are obtained for power-law and Band function emission spectra. For internal shocks the observed instantaneous spectrum is very close to the emitted one, and should be well described by a Band function also during the RDP. Our model naturally produces, the observed spectral softening and steepening of the flux decay. The observed flux during the RDP is initially dominated by the tail of the last pulse, but the tails of one or more earlier pulses can become dominant later on. Moreover, modeling several overlapping pulses as a single wider pulse would over-predict the emission tail. Thus, one should be very careful when testing the predictions of HLE and do a combined temporal and spectral fit of the prompt GRB emission and the RDP.", "published": "2008-12-26T13:34:50+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-15T15:22:53+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4677v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15355.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15355.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4677v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4677v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

If not properly removed, these sources have adverse effects on the estimation of the power-spectrum and/or the test of Gaussianity of the CMB component. The techniques to extract point sources from an observed image used up to now do not show a general consensus about their real performance and properties. Their characteristics have been studied essentially through numerical simulations based on semi-empirical models of the CMB and the Galactic foreground. Such models often have different levels of sophistication and/or are based on different physical assumptions (e.g. the number of Galactic components and level of the noise). Moreover, the application of a given technique to a set of data (either simulated or experimental) requires the tuning of one or more parameters that unavoidably is a subjective operation. Hence, a reliable comparison is difficult. What is missing is a statistical analysis of the properties of the proposed methodologies. This is the aim of the present paper. The statistical properties of the detection techniques in the context of two different criteria, i.e. the Neyman-Pearson criterion and the maximization of the signal-to-noise ratio, are analyzed through an analytical approach. Various examples, techniques and the conditions under which they work satisfactorily are shown together with their limits and implementation details.

We derive the 3D velocity anisotropy and galaxy number density profiles using a model-independent method to solve the Jeans equation, simultaneously incorporating the observed velocity dispersion profile, the galaxy counts from deep Subaru imaging, and our previously derived cluster mass profile from a joint lensing and X-ray analysis. The velocity anisotropy is found to be predominantly radial at large radius, becoming increasingly tangential towards the center, in accord with expectations. We also analyze the galaxy data independently of our previous analysis using two different methods: The first is based on a solution of the Jeans equation assuming an NFW form for the mass distribution, whereas in the second method the caustic amplitude is used to determine the escape velocity. The cluster virial mass derived by both of these dynamical methods is in good agreement with results from our earlier lensing and X-ray analysis. We also confirm the high NFW concentration parameter, with results from both methods combined to yield $c_{\\rm vir}>13$ (1$\\sigma$).

In models where haloes form from a spherical collapse, the distribution of halo creation times can be estimated from the same formalism which is used to estimate halo abundances: the constant-barrier excursion-set approach. In the excursion set approach, moving, rather than constant-barriers, are necessary for estimating halo abundances when the collapse is triaxial. We show how the corresponding estimates are modified by providing analytic estimates of the creation rate for a wide range of halo masses. We then show that these moving-barrier based predictions are in better agreement with measurements in numerical simulations than are the corresponding predictions of the spherical collapse model. These results should be useful for studies of merger-driven star-formation rates and AGN activity. We also present a similar study of creation of haloes conditioned on belonging to an object of a certain mass today, and reach similar conclusions - the moving barrier based estimates are in substantially better agreement with the simulations.

To determine what E+A galaxies become after their young stellar populations fade away, we present the detailed morphologies of 21 E+As using HST images. We find that E+As are similar to early types in that they have large bulge fractions (median B/T = 0.59), high Sersic index (n > 4), and high concentration indices (C > 4.3). The large fraction (70%) of E+As with positive color gradients (i.e., bluer nuclei) indicates that the young stellar populations are more concentrated than the old populations. We show that these positive color gradients can evolve into the negative gradients typical in E/S0s if the central parts of these galaxies are metal enhanced. E+A galaxies stand apart from the E/S0s in the edge-on projection of the Fundamental Plane, implying that E+As have, on average, a M/L that is ~3.8 times smaller than that of E/S0s. The tilt of the E+A FP indicates that the variation among stellar populations in these galaxies is closely tied to their structural parameters such that smaller or less massive galaxies have smaller M/L. We find a population of unresolved compact sources in nine E+As (45%). Their colors and luminosities are consistent with the hypothesis that these are newly formed star clusters. The bright end of the cluster LF is fainter in redder E+A's, suggesting that the young star cluster systems have faded or been disrupted as the merger remnant aged. In summary, the morphologies, color profiles, scaling relations, and cluster populations are all consistent with the hypothesis that E+As galaxies are the results of mergers that evolve into early-type galaxies.", "published": "2008-01-08T09:15:55+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-10T18:31:36+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.1190v3", "doi": "10.1086/591656 10.1088/0004-637X/702/2/1683", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/591656", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/702/2/1683", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1190v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.1190v3"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.688:945-971,2008; Erratum-ibid.702:1683,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The unified sequence of blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) is taken into account to make a non-trivial prediction for the EGRB spectrum and more realistic comparison with the data than previous studies. We then try to explain the EGRB data by the two AGN populations: one is blazars, and the other is non-blazar AGNs that are responsible for the EGRB in the MeV band. We find that ~80% of the EGRB photon flux at > 100 MeV can be explained by the sum of the two populations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. The predicted EGRB spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from X-ray to GeV, within the systematic uncertainties in the EGRB determination by EGRET. These results indicate that AGNs including blazars are the primary source of EGRB. Blazars are dominant in EGRB at higher energy bands of >100 MeV, while non-blazar AGNs dominate at <100 MeV. Almost all of the EGRB flux from blazars will be resolved into discrete sources by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, while that from non-blazar AGNs will largely remain unresolved. Therefore, comparison between the integrated source counts and diffuse EGRB flux as a function of photon energy will give a simple and clear test of our model.

First, by removing superfluous mergers that are artifacts of the FOF halo finder, we find a lower merger rate compared to previous work. The reductions are more significant at lower redshifts, lower halo masses, and minor mergers. Our approach agrees better with predictions from the EPS model. Second, we find that the FOF halo finder overestimates the halo mass by up to 50% for halos that are about to merge, which leads to an additional ~20% overestimate of the merger rate. Therefore, we define halo masses by including only gravitationally bound particles. We provide new best-fitting parameters for a global formula to account for these improvements. In addition, we extract the merger rate per progenitor halo, as well as per descendant halo. The former is the quantity that is related to observed galaxy merger fractions when they are measured via pair counting. At low mass/redshift the merger rate increases with mass and redshift. At high mass/redshift (for halos with masses a few times the \"knee\" of the mass function) these trends break down, and the merger rate per progenitor halo decreases with mass and increases only moderately with redshift. Defining the merger rate per progenitor halo also allows us to quantify the rate at which halos are being accreted onto larger halos.

Tiscareno", "Renu Malhotra"], "summary": "We carried out extensive numerical orbit integrations to probe the long-term chaotic dynamics of the two strongest mean motion resonances of Neptune in the Kuiper belt, the 3:2 (Plutinos) and 2:1 (Twotinos). Our primary results include a computation of the relative volumes of phase space characterized by large- and small-resonance libration amplitudes, and maps of resonance stability measured by mean chaotic diffusion rate. We find that Neptune's 2:1 resonance has weaker overall long-term stability than the 3:2 -- only ~15% of Twotinos are projected to survive for 4 Gyr, compared to ~27% of Plutinos, based on an extrapolation from our 1-Gyr integrations. We find that Pluto has only a modest effect, causing a ~4% decrease in the Plutino population that survives to 4 Gyr. Given current observational estimates, and assuming an initial distribution of particles proportional to the local phase space volume in the resonance, we conclude that the primordial populations of Plutinos and Twotinos formerly made up more than half the population of the classical and resonant Kuiper Belt. We also conclude that Twotinos were originally nearly as numerous as Plutinos; this is consistent with predictions from early models of smooth giant planet migration and resonance sweeping of the Kuiper Belt, and provides a useful constraint for more detailed models.", "published": "2008-07-17T17:10:21+00:00", "updated": "2009-07-06T16:06:40+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2835v3", "doi": "10.1088/0004-6256/138/3/827", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/138/3/827", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2835v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.2835v3"], "journal_reference": "Astron.

Various features and limitations of the new UKIDSS data are examined, such as a problem affecting Petrosian magnitudes of extended sources. Selection limits in K- and r-band magnitude, K-band surface brightness and K-band radius are included explicitly in the 1/Vmax estimate of the space density and luminosity function. The bivariate brightness distribution in K-band absolute magnitude and surface brightness is presented and found to display a clear luminosity--surface brightness correlation that flattens at high luminosity and broadens at low luminosity, consistent with similar analyses at optical wavelengths. Best fitting Schechter function parameters for the K-band luminosity function are found to be M*-5 log h=-23.19 +/- 0.04, alpha=-0.81 +/- 0.04 and phi*=(0.0166 +/- 0.0008)h^3 Mpc^{-3}, although the Schechter function provides a poor fit to the data at high and low luminosity, while the luminosity density in the K band is found to be j = (6.305 +/- 0.067) x 10^8 L_sun h Mpc^{-3}.

Beloborodov"], "summary": "Magnetospheres of neutron stars are anchored in the rigid crust and can be twisted by sudden crustal motions (\"starquakes\"). The twisted magnetosphere does not remain static and gradually untwists, dissipating magnetic energy and producing radiation. The equation describing this evolution is derived, and its solutions are presented. Two distinct regions coexist in untwisting magnetospheres: a potential region where curl(B)=0 (\"cavity\") and a current-carrying bundle of field lines (\"j-bundle\"). The cavity has a sharp boundary, which expands with time and eventually erases all of the twist. In this process, the electric current of the j-bundle is sucked into the star. Observational appearance of the untwisting process is discussed. A hot spot forms at the footprints of the j-bundle. The spot shrinks with time toward the magnetic dipole axis, and its luminosity and temperature gradually decrease. As the j-bundle shrinks, the amplitude of its twist can grow to the maximum possible value ~ 1. The strong twist near the dipole axis increases the spindown rate of the star and can generate a broad beam of radio emission. The model explains the puzzling behavior of magnetar XTE J1810-197 -- a canonical example of magnetospheric evolution following a starquake. We also discuss implications for other magnetars.

We present two-point correlation functions of spiral and early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology and environment with marked correlation functions. These yield clear and precise environmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similar measurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the Galaxy Zoo classifications themselves are very precise. We measure morphology marked correlation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak, with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales, indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. At fixed morphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong, and these correlations remain for fixed morphology \\textit{and} luminosity. An implication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due to the relation between colour and density. Our results also have implications for galaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usually accompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. A spiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagram without quickly becoming an early-type. We analyze the significant population of red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located in moderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes.

Some of these were previously briefly discussed as plausible models for SCP 06F6, in particular with the claimed detection of a z=0.143 cosmological redshift of a Swan spectrum of a carbon rich envelope. We adopt this value of z for extragalactic scenarios. We cannot rule out any of these models, but can rank them from most to least preferred. Our favorite model is a tidal disruption of a CO white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). To account for the properties of the SCP 06F6 event, we have to assume the presence of a strong disk wind that was not included in previous numerical simulations. If the IMBH is the central BH of a galaxy, this explains the non detection of a bright galaxy in the direction of SCP 06F6. Our second favorite scenario is a type Ia-like SN that exploded inside the dense wind of a carbon star. The carbon star is the donor star of the exploded WD. Our third favorite model is a Galactic source of an asteroid that collided with a WD. Such a scenario was discussed in the past as the source of dusty disks around WDs, but no predictions exist regarding the appearance of such an event. Our least favorite model is of a core collapse SN.

However, sometimes flashes are seen from transient binary systems when they are thought to be in their quiescent phase, during which no accretion, or relatively little, is expected to occur. We investigate the accretion luminosity during several such flashes, including the first-ever and brightest detected flash from Cen X-4 in 1969. We infer from observations and theory that immediately prior to these flashes the accretion rate must have been between about 0.001 and 0.01 times the equivalent of the Eddington limit, which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude less than the peak accretion rates seen in these transients during an X-ray outburst and 3-4 orders of magnitude more than the lowest measured values in quiescence. Furthermore, three such flashes, including the one from Cen X-4, occurred within 2 to 7 days followed by an X-ray outburst. A long-term episode of enhanced, but low-level, accretion is predicted near the end of the quiescent phase by the disk-instability model, and may thus have provided the right conditions for these flashes to occur. We discuss the possibility of whether these flashes acted as triggers of the outbursts, signifying a dramatic increase in the accretion rate.

Z. Stanek", "Matthew D. Kistler", "John F. Beacom", "Christopher S. Kochanek"], "summary": "The progenitors of SN 2008S and the 2008 transient in NGC300 were dust-enshrouded, with extremely red mid-infrared (MIR) colors and relatively low luminosities. The transients were optically faint (-13 < M_V < -15) compared to normal core-collapse supernovae (SNe), and their spectra exhibited narrow emission lines. These events are unique among transient-progenitor pairs and hence constitute a new class. Whether they are true SNe or bright massive-star eruptions, we argue that their rate is ~20% of the SN rate. This fact is remarkable in light of the observation that a very small fraction of all massive stars have the MIR colors of the SN 2008S and NGC300 progenitors, as we show using MIR and optical luminosity, color, and variability properties of massive stars in M33. We find that the fraction of massive stars with colors consistent with these progenitors is 1/10000. In fact, only < 10 similar objects exist in M33 - all of which lie at the luminous red extremum of the AGB sequence. That these transients are relatively common with respect to SNe, while their progenitors are rare compared to the massive star population, implies that the dust-enshrouded phase is a short-lived phase in the lives of many massive stars. This shrouded epoch can occur only in the last ~10^4 yr before explosion, be it death or merely eruption. We discuss the implications of this finding for the evolution and census of ``low-mass'' massive stars (8-12 Msun), and we connect it with theoretical discussions of electron-capture SNe and the explosive birth of white dwarfs. A systematic census with (warm) Spitzer of galaxies in the local universe for analogous progenitors would significantly improve our knowledge of this channel to massive stellar explosions, and potentially to others with obscured progenitors.

Lee", "Shin'ichiro Ando", "Marc Kamionkowski"], "summary": "One of the targets of the recently launched Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a diffuse gamma-ray background from dark-matter annihilation or decay in the Galactic halo. N-body simulations and theoretical arguments suggest that the dark matter in the Galactic halo may be clumped into substructure, rather than smoothly distributed. Here we propose the gamma-ray-flux probability distribution function (PDF) as a probe of substructure in the Galactic halo. We calculate this PDF for a phenomenological model of halo substructure and determine the regions of the substructure parameter space in which the PDF may be distinguished from the PDF for a smooth distribution of dark matter. In principle, the PDF allows a statistical detection of substructure, even if individual halos cannot be detected. It may also allow detection of substructure on the smallest microhalo mass scales, $\\sim M_\\oplus$, for weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Furthermore, it may also provide a method to measure the substructure mass function. However, an analysis that assumes a typical halo substructure model and a conservative estimate of the diffuse background suggests that the substructure PDF may not be detectable in the lifespan of Fermi in the specific case that the WIMP is a neutralino. Nevertheless, for a large range of substructure, WIMP annihilation, and diffuse background models, PDF analysis may provide a clear signature of substructure.", "published": "2008-10-07T22:07:52+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-30T22:30:55+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1284v2", "doi": "10.1088/1475-7516/2009/07/007", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2009/07/007", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1284v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1284v2"], "journal_reference": "JCAP 0907:007,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Assuming a single relation between elliptical galaxy/bulge mass, M_Bulge, and central black hole mass, M_BH, we find that 55^{+8}_{-4} per cent of the mass in black holes in the local universe is in the centres of elliptical galaxies, 41^{+4}_{-2} per cent in classical bulges and 4^{+0.9}_{-0.4} per cent in pseudo-bulges. We find that ellipticals, classical bulges and pseudo-bulges follow different relations between their stellar masses and sigma, and the most significant offset occurs for pseudo-bulges in barred galaxies. This structural dissimilarity leads to discrepant black hole masses if single M_BH-M_Bulge and M_BH-sigma relations are used.

Quark-Novae are predicted to arise from the explosive collapse (and conversion) of sufficiently massive neutron stars into quark stars. A Quark-Nova (QN) can occur over a range of time scales following the supernova event. For QNe that arise days to weeks after the supernovae, we show that dual-shock that arises as the QN ejecta encounter the supernova ejecta can produce enough photons to reionize hydrogen in most of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM) by z ~ 6. Such events can explain the large optical depth tau_e ~ 0.1 as measured by WMAP, if the clumping factor, C, of the material being ionized is smaller than 10. We suggest a way in which a normal initial mass function (IMF) for the oldest stars can be reconciled with a large optical depth as well as the mean metallicity of the early IGM post reionization. We find that QN also make a contribution to r-process element abundances for atomic numbers A > 130.

Instead we treat these three quantities as independent dynamical variables. We show that this action reproduces the standard Einstein field equations depending on a single metric tensor. We further show that in this formulation the cosmological constant has an additional theoretical significance. Normally the cosmological constant is added to the Einstein field equations for the purpose of having general relativity be consistent with cosmological observations.

In particular, the differential rotation is now well constrained by helioseismic observations. Helioseismology also gives us information about the depth-dependence of the meridional circulation in the near-surface layers. The typical velocity inputs used in solar dynamo models, however, continue to be an analytic fit to the observed differential rotation and a theoretically constructed meridional flow profile that matches only the peak flow speed at the surface. Here we take the first steps towards realistic helioseismic data assimilation, by presenting methodologies for constructing differential rotation and meridional circulation profiles that more closely conform to the observational constraints currently available. We also present simulations driven by the assimilated rotation and four plausible profiles for the internal meridional circulation -- all of which match the helioseismically inferred near-surface depth-dependence, but whose magnitudes are made to vary. We discuss how the results compare with those that are driven by purely analytic fits. Our results indicate that the latitudinal shear of the rotation in the bulk of the solar convection zone plays a more important role, than either the tachocline or surface radial shear, in the induction of toroidal field. We also find that it is the speed of the equatorward counter-flow in the meridional flow at the base of the convection zone, and not how far into the radiative interior it penetrates, that primarily determines the dynamo cycle period. Given that improved helioseismic constraints are expected to be available in the future, our analysis lays the basis for assimilating these data within dynamo models.", "published": "2008-11-20T23:46:36+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-29T20:43:11+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3441v3", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/461", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/461", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3441v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3441v3"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.698:461-478,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Age estimates derived with symmetric hydrodynamic models fitted to an asymmetric magnetized superbubble can differ by up to a factor of four, depending on the direction of the line of sight.

Galaxies in the FLASH and 6dFGS redshift surveys are cross-identified with NVSS radio sources, selected in a subsample doubly complete in volume and luminosity. Environmental effects are studied through a smoothed density field (normalized with random catalogs with the same survey edges and redshift selection function) and the distance to the nearest cluster (R/r200, where r200 is the virial radius, whose relation to the aperture velocity dispersion is quantified). The fraction of high radio loudness (R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core of the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is anti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated with R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x less radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in the SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This correlation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200 (K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio loudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that destroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.", "published": "2007-04-25T19:52:37+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-29T15:32:09+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3431v3", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361:20077721", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20077721", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3431v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3431v3"], "journal_reference": "A&A (2007) 475, 169-185 (2007); Erratum in A&A (2009) 499,45", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to 1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; 2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and 3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of ~17(+7,-10) since z=4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization Phi*. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies.

This peak does not necessarily coincide with the broad band (keV-GeV) power peak. We show that this thermal component exhibits a characteristic temporal behavior. We study a sample of 56 long bursts, all strong enough to allow time-resolved spectroscopy. We analyze the evolution of both the temperature and flux of the thermal component in 49 individual time-resolved pulses, for which the temporal coverage is sufficient, and find that the temperature is nearly constant during the first few seconds, after which it decays as a power law with a sample-averaged index of -0.68. The thermal flux first rises with an averaged power-law index of 0.63 after which it decays with an averaged index of -2. The break times are the same to within errors. We find that the ratio of the observed to the emergent thermal flux typically exhibits a monotoneous power-law increase during the entire pulse as well as during complex bursts. Thermal photons carry a significant fraction ($\\sim$ 30 % to more than 50%) of the prompt emission energy (in the observed 25-1900 keV energy band), thereby significantly contributing to the high radiative efficiency.

We compute both a spherically-averaged surrogate for phase-space density (Q) and the coarse-grained distribution function f(x,v) for dark matter particles that lie within~2 virial radii of four Milky-Way-sized dark matter halos. The estimated f(x,v) spans over four decades at any radius. Dark matter particles that end up within two virial radii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian distribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes increasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of the Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a power-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark matter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in the center of the main halo. The power-law Q(r) profile likely reflects the distribution of entropy (K = sigma^2/rho^{2/3} \\propto r^{1.2}), which dark matter acquires as it is accreted onto a growing halo. The estimated f(x, v), on the other hand, exhibits a more complicated behavior. Although the median coarse-grained phase-space density profile F(r) can be approximated by a power-law in the inner regions of halos and at larger radii the profile flattens significantly. This is because phase-space density averaged on small scales is sensitive to the high-f material associated with surviving subhalos, as well as relatively unmixed material (probably in streams) resulting from disrupted subhalos, which contribute a sizable fraction of matter at large radii.

These data represent the first deep observation of one of these extreme mass-to-light systems and the first dedicated dark matter search using an X-ray telescope. No such emission line is positively detected, and we place new constraints on the combination of the sterile neutrino mass and the active-sterile neutrino oscillation mixing angle. Line flux upper limits are derived using a maximum-likelihood-based approach that, along with the lack of intrinsic X-ray emission, enables us to minimize systematics and account for those that remain. The limits we derive match or approach the best previous results over the entire 1--20 keV mass range from a single Suzaku observation. These are used to place constraints on the existence of sterile neutrinos with given parameters in the general case and in the case where they are assumed to constitute all of the dark matter.

In addition, we re-evaluate opacities due to free-free transitions, taking into account the motion of both interacting particles, electron and proton, in a strong magnetic field. Compared to the previous neutron-star atmosphere models, the free-free absorption is strongly suppressed at photon frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. The latter result holds for any field strength, which prompts a revision of existing theoretical models of X-ray spectra of magnetar atmospheres.

We identify an interesting ECS bump in the time evolution of HMXB numbers; this bump is caused by significantly increased production of wind-fed HMXBs 20-60 Myr post starburst. The amplitude and age extent of the ECS bump depend on the strength of ECS kicks and the mass range of ECS progenitors. We also find that ECS-HMXBs form through a specific evolutionary channel that is expected to lead to binaries with Be donors in wide orbits. These characteristics, along with their sensitivity to ECS properties, provide us with an intriguing opportunity to probe ECS physics and progenitors through studies of starbursts of different ages.

The model, which we call the Substellar and Planetary Atmospheric Radiation and Circulation (SPARC) model, adopts the MITgcm for the dynamics and uses the radiative model of McKay, Marley, Fortney, and collaborators for the radiation. Like earlier work with simplified forcing, our simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet, mean westward flow at higher latitudes, and substantial flow over the poles at low pressure. For HD 189733b, our simulations without TiO and VO opacity can explain the broad features of the observed 8 and 24-micron light curves, including the modest day-night flux variation and the fact that the planet/star flux ratio peaks before the secondary eclipse. Our simulations also provide reasonable matches to the Spitzer secondary-eclipse depths at 4.5, 5.8, 8, 16, and 24 microns and the groundbased upper limit at 2.2 microns. However, we substantially underpredict the 3.6-micron secondary-eclipse depth, suggesting that our simulations are too cold in the 0.1-1 bar region. Predicted temporal variability in secondary-eclipse depths is ~1% at Spitzer bandpasses, consistent with recent observational upper limits at 8 microns. We also show that nonsynchronous rotation can significantly alter the jet structure. For HD 209458b, we include TiO and VO opacity; these simulations develop a hot (>2000 K) dayside stratosphere. Despite this stratosphere, we do not reproduce current Spitzer photometry of this planet.

The use of global analysis has the advantage that no biases are introduced, either in n_s or in the related error bar, by the a priori choice of a single angular scale. The case of continuous, uniformly distributed sources is nominally disfavored at 99% C.L. and the fit improves if the sources follow the large-scale structure of matter in the universe. The best fit values obtained for the number density of proton sources are within a factor ~2 around n_s ~ 10^{-4}/Mpc^3 and depend mainly on the Auger energy calibration scale, with lower densities being preferred if the current scale is correct.

It is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration scheme where the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments of the transfer equation and by using a variable Eddington tensor as a closure relation, following the `OTVET'-suggestion of Gnedin & Abel. We derive a suitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the SPH discretization of the local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver that guarantees robustness and photon conservation. This entails a matrix inversion problem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory in our parallel code. We solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradient scheme. Finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation and recombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemical network that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. We present several tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources in static uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowing by a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field. All tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictions from other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing.

A bright ridge of X-ray and radio continuum emission has been interpreted as the result of shock heating, with support from observations at other wavelengths. We find that gas in this ridge has a similar temperature (~0.6 keV) and abundance (~0.3 solar) to the surrounding diffuse emission, and that a hard emission component is consistent with that expected from high-mass X-ray binaries associated with star-formation in the ridge. The cooling rate of gas in the ridge is consistent with the current star formation rate, suggesting that radiative cooling is driving the observed star formation. The lack of a high-temperature gas component is used to place constraints on the nature of the interaction and shock, and we find that an oblique shock heating a pre-existing filament of HI may be the most likely explanation of the X-ray gas in the ridge. The mass of hot gas in the ridge is only ~2 per cent of the total mass of hot gas in the group, which is roughly equal to the deficit in observed HI mass compared to predictions. The hot gas component is too extended to have been heated by the current interaction, strongly suggesting that it must have been heated during previous dynamical encounters.", "published": "2008-12-01T22:38:59+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-22T20:23:44+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0383v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/701/2/1560", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/701/2/1560", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0383v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0383v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.701:1560-1568,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The situation is considerably different when looking at the internal evolution, quantified in terms of their shape, compactness and density profile, and substructure in terms of their multiplicity function. We find a continuing evolution from a wide range of triaxial shapes at a = 1 to almost perfect spherical shapes at a = 100. We also find a systematic trend towards a higher concentration.

Using similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an early formation epoch with a reduced mass growth rate at late times. We then find that a primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the massive halo. Using the restricted three-body problem, we show that haloes are prone to tidal mass loss within 1.5 virial radii of a larger halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of formation epoch on environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong.

In this first paper in a series we develop a flexible but efficient pipeline to simulate lensing by realistic galaxy models. These galaxy models have separate stellar and dark matter components, each with a range of density profiles and shapes representative of early-type, central galaxies without significant contributions from other nearby galaxies. We use Fourier methods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surface density distributions, and Monte Carlo methods to compute lensing statistics such as point-source lensing cross-sections. Incorporating a variety of magnification bias modes lets us examine different survey limitations in image resolution and flux. We rigorously test the numerical methods for systematic errors and sensitivity to basic assumptions. We also determine the minimum number of viewing angles that must be sampled in order to recover accurate orientation-averaged lensing quantities. We find that for a range of non-isothermal stellar and dark matter density profiles typical of elliptical galaxies, the combined density profile and corresponding lensing properties are surprisingly close to isothermal around the Einstein radius.

The distinctive kinematics of the dark disk matches the stars that also entered in the satellites. The lower velocities of the dark disk with respect to the Earth enhances detection rates at low recoil energy. For WIMP masses > 50 GeV/c^2, the detection rate increases by up to a factor of 3 in the 5 - 20 keV recoil energy range. Comparing this with rates at higher energy will improve constraints on the WIMP mass, particularly for masses > 100 GeV/c^2.

Since the strength of electron capture on the neutron-rich nuclei associated to the supernova scenario is still an open issue, we keep it as a free parameter. We find that the temperature dependence of the symmetry energy consistently yields a small reduction of deleptonization, which corresponds to a systematic effect on the shock wave energetics: the gain in dissociation energy of the shock has a small yet non-negligible value of about 0.4 foe (1 foe = 10^51 erg) and this result is almost independent from the strength of nuclear electron capture.

Our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the X-ray transient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us to derive constraints on the nature of the SN and its progenitor; throughout we draw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several key aspects that differ. We show that the X-ray spectrum of XRT 080109 can be fit equally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal parts of both power law and blackbody. Our data first established that SN 2008D is a spectroscopically normal SN Ib (i.e., showing conspicuous He lines), and show that SN 2008D had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest optical peak luminosity. The early-time light curves of the SN are dominated by a cooling stellar envelope (for \\Delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the blue bands) followed by 56^Ni decay. We construct a reliable measurement of the bolometric output for this stripped-envelope SN, and, combined with estimates of E_K and M_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius R_star of its probable Wolf-Rayet progenitor. According to the model of Waxman et al. and of Chevalier & Fransson, we derive R_star^{W07}= 1.2+/-0.7 R_sun and R_star^{CF08}= 12+/-7 R_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line with typical WN stars.

From first principles, we initiate the development of a mathematical theory of stochastic microlensing. Beginning with the random time delay function and associated lensing map, we determine exact expressions for the mean and variance of these transformations. We characterize the exact p.d.f. of a normalized random time delay function at the origin, showing that it is a shifted gamma distribution, which also holds at leading order in the limit of a large number of point masses at a general point of the lens plane. For the large number of point masses limit, we also prove that the asymptotic p.d.f. of the random lensing map under a specified scaling converges to a bivariate normal distribution. We show analytically that the p.d.f. of the random scaled lensing map at leading order depends on the magnitude of the scaled bending angle due purely to point masses as well as demonstrate explicitly how this radial symmetry is broken at the next order. Interestingly, we found at leading order a formula linking the expectation and variance of the normalized random time delay function to the first Betti number of its domain. We also determine an asymptotic p.d.f. for the random bending angle vector and find an integral expression for the probability of a lens plane point being near a fixed point. Lastly, we show explicitly how the results are affected by location in the lens plane. The results of this paper are relevant to the theory of random fields and provide a platform for further generalizations as well as analytical limits for checking astrophysical studies of stochastic microlensing.", "published": "2008-07-01T20:05:24+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-16T19:34:47+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0232v2", "doi": "10.1063/1.3158854", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3158854", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0232v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0232v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

To probe the properties of the IC 348 disk population, we combine these data with previous optical/infrared photometry and spectroscopy to identify stars with gas accretion, to examine their mid-IR colors,and to model their spectral energy distributions. IC 348 contains many sources in different evolutionary states, including protostars and stars surrounded by primordial disks, two kinds of transitional disks, and debris disks. Most disks surrounding eary/intermediate spectral-type stars (> 1.4 Msun at 2.5 Myr) are debris disks; most disks surrounding solar and subsolar-mass stars are primordial disks. At the 1--2 sigma level, more massive stars also have a smaller frequency of gas accretion and smaller mid-IR luminosities than lower-mass stars. These trends are suggestive of a stellar mass-dependent evolution of disks, where most disks around high/intermediate-mass stars shed their primordial disks on rapid, 2.5 Myr timescales. The frequency of MIPS-detected transitional disks is ~ 15--35% for stars plausibly more massive than 0.5 Msun.

This is achieved by applying a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain the 6 free parameters that define the stellar and black-hole mass functions at redshift zero. The model is tested against three different observational data sets, including the galaxy K-band luminosity function, B-V colours, and the black hole-bulge mass relation, separately and combined, to obtain mean values, confidence limits and likelihood contours for the best fit model. Using each observational data set independently, we discuss how the SA model parameters affect each galaxy property and to what extent the correlations between them can lead to improved understandings of the physics of galaxy formation. When all the observations are combined, we find reasonable agreement between the majority of the previously published parameter values and our confidence limits. However, the need to suppress dwarf galaxy formation requires the strength of the supernova feedback to be significantly higher in our best-fit solution than in previous work. To balance this, we require the feedback to become ineffective in halos of lower circular velocity than before, so as to permit the formation of sufficient high-luminosity galaxies: unfortunately, this leads to an excess of galaxies around L*. Although the best-fit is formally consistent with the data, there is no region of parameter space that reproduces the shape of galaxy luminosity function across the whole magnitude-range.

The dark turbulence will not eddy dominant reflecting the collision-less property. After deriving Kolmogorov scaling laws from Navier-Stokes equation by the method similar to the one for Smoluchowski coagulation equation, we apply this to several observations such as the scale-dependent velocity dispersion, mass-luminosity ratio, magnetic fields, and mass-angular momentum relation, power spectrum of density fluctuations.

We develop the counts-in-cells framework for the multi-tracer approach, and use this to derive expressions for the full non-Gaussian covariance matrix. We show, that for the usual auto-power statistic, besides the off-diagonal covariance generated through gravitational mode-coupling, the discreteness of the tracers and their associated sampling distribution can generate strong off-diagonal covariance, and that this becomes the dominant source of covariance as k>>k_f=2 pi/L. On comparison with the derived expressions for the cross-power covariance, we show that the off-diagonal terms can be suppressed, if one cross-correlates a high tracer-density sample with a low one. Taking the effective estimator efficiency to be proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SN), we show that, to probe clustering as a function of physical properties of the sample, i.e. cluster mass or galaxy luminosity, then the cross-power approach can out perform the auto-power one by factors of a few. We confront the theory with measurements of the mass-mass, halo-mass, and halo-halo power spectra from a large ensemble of N-body simulations. We show that there is a significant SN advantage to be gained from using the cross-power approach when studying the bias of rare haloes. The analysis is repeated in configuration space and again SN improvement is found. We estimate the covariance matrix for these samples, and find strong off-diagonal contributions. The covariance depends on halo mass, with higher mass samples having stronger covariance. In agreement with theory, we show that the covariance is suppressed for the cross-power.

The location of these families changes under a modification of the fundamental frequencies of the planets and we show how the resonant structure would evolve during a planetary migration. We present a general method, based on the knowledge of the fundamental frequencies of the planets and on those that can be reached by the Trojans, which makes it possible to predict and localize the main events arising in the swarms during migration. In particular, we show how the size and stability of the Trojan swarms are affected by the modification of the frequencies of the planets. Finally, we use this method to study the global dynamics of the Jovian Trojan swarms when Saturn migrates outwards.

(2) However, the clumps are bounded by phase-transition fronts rather than by contact discontinuities, and thus they grow in size and mass mainly by accretion of WNM material through their boundaries. (3) The clump boundaries generally consist of thin layers of thermally unstable gas, but these layers are often widened by the turbulence, and penetrate deep into the clumps. (4) The clumps are approximately in both ram and thermal pressure balance with their surroundings, a condition which causes their internal Mach numbers to be comparable to the bulk Mach number of the colliding WNM flows. (5) The clumps typically have mean temperatures 20 < T < 50 K, corresponding to the wide range of densities they contain (20 < n < 5000 pcc) under a nearly-isothermal equation of state. (6) The turbulent ram pressure fluctuations of the WNM induce density fluctuations that then serve as seeds for local gravitational collapse within the clumps. (7) The velocity and magnetic fields tend to be aligned with each other within the clumps, although both are significantly fluctuating, suggesting that the velocity tends to stretch and align the magnetic field with it.

We study big-bang nucleosynthesis with the radiative particle decay using the new photodisintegration cross sections of $^4$He as well as previous data. The sensitivity of the yields of all light elements D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He, $^6$Li, $^7$Li and $^7$Be to the cross sections is investigated. The change of the cross sections has an influence on the non-thermal yields of D, $^3$He and $^4$He.

The non-thermal nucleosynthesis triggered by the radiative particle decay is one of candidates of the production mechanism of $^6$Li observed in metal-poor halo stars (MPHSs).

Richard Gott III", "John Dubinski"], "summary": "In support of the new Sloan III survey, which will measure the baryon oscillation scale using the luminous red galaxies (LRGs), we have run the largest N-body simulation to date using $4120^3 = 69.9$ billion particles, and covering a volume of $(6.592 h^{-1} {\\rm Gpc})^3$. This is over 2000 times the volume of the Millennium Run, and corner-to-corner stretches all the way to the horizon of the visible universe. LRG galaxies are selected by finding the most massive gravitationally bound, cold dark matter subhalos, not subject to tidal disruption, a technique that correctly reproduces the 3D topology of the LRG galaxies in the Sloan Survey.We have measured the covariance function, power spectrum, and the 3D topology of the LRG galaxy distribution in our simulation and made 32 mock surveys along the past lightcone to simulate the Sloan III survey. Our large N-body simulation is used to accurately measure the non-linear systematic effects such as gravitational evolution, redshift space distortion, past light cone space gradient, and galaxy biasing, and to calibrate the baryon oscillation scale and the genus topology. For example, we predict from our mock surveys that the baryon acoustic oscillation peak scale can be measured with the cosmic variance-dominated uncertainty of about 5% when the SDSS-III sample is divided into three equal volume shells, or about 2.6% when a thicker shell with $0.4<z<0.6$ is used. We find that one needs to correct the scale for the systematic effects amounting up to 5.2% to use it to constrain the linear theories. And the uncertainty in the amplitude of the genus curve is expected to be about 1% at 15 $h^{-1}$Mpc scale.

The main results are maps of the SZE in this massive, merging galaxy cluster. The cluster is detected with 23 sigma significance within the central 1 arcmin radius of the source position. The SZE map has a broadly similar morphology to that in existing X-ray maps of this system, and we find no evidence for significant contamination of the SZE emission by radio or IR sources. In order to make simple quantitative comparisons with cluster gas models derived from X-ray observations, we fit our data to an isothermal elliptical beta model, despite the inadequacy of such a model for this complex merging system. With an X-ray derived prior on the power-law index, beta = 1.04 +0.16 -0.10, we find a core radius r_c =142 +/- 18 arcsec, an axial ratio of 0.889 +/- 0.072, and a central temperature decrement of -771 +/- 71 micro-K_CMB, including a +/-5.5% flux calibration uncertainty. Combining the APEX-SZ map with a map of projected electron surface density from Chandra X-ray observations, we determine the mass-weighted temperature of the cluster gas to be T_mg=10.8 +/- 0.9 keV, significantly lower than some previously reported X-ray spectroscopic temperatures. Under the assumption of an isothermal cluster gas distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium, we compute the gas mass fraction for prolate and oblate spheroidal geometries and find it to be consistent with previous results from X-ray and weak lensing observations.

We compare the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model for the luminosities, morphologies, colours and scale-lengths of local galaxies. GALFORM models the luminosity and size of the disk and bulge components of a galaxy, and so we can compute quantities which can be compared directly with SDSS observations, such as the Petrosian magnitude and the Sersic index. We test the predictions of two published models set in the cold dark matter cosmology: the Baugh et al. (2005) model, which assumes a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) in starbursts and superwind feedback, and the Bower et al. (2006) model, which uses AGN feedback and a standard IMF. The Bower et al model better reproduces the overall shape of the luminosity function, the morphology-luminosity relation and the colour bimodality observed in the SDSS data, but gives a poor match to the size-luminosity relation. The \\Baugh et al. model successfully predicts the size-luminosity relation for late-type galaxies. Both models fail to reproduce the sizes of bright early-type galaxies.

Kravtsov"], "summary": "We use dissipationless N-body simulations to investigate the evolution of the true coarse-grained phase-space density distribution f(x,v) in equal-mass mergers between dark matter (DM) halos. The halo models are constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-like profiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``Enbid'' developed by Sharma & Steinmetz to compute f(x,v). The adopted force resolution allows robust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial radii of the simulated systems. We confirm that mergers result in a decrease of the coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations from Mixing Theorems for collisionless systems. We demonstrate that binary mergers between identical DM halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories of the inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution of their progenitors. The robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds for a range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurations including sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimic hierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmological epochs. If the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably different asymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape of the phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer to that of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. These results explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergers between DM halos, as it does not erase memory of the progenitor properties.

This spectral structure leads to a consistent approximation for dynamical equations that describe coherent evolution in presence of decohering collisions. We illustrate the method by solving the bosonic Klein problem and the bound states for the nonrelativistic square well potential.

Models surviving bounds from, e.g, antiproton production generally fall into two classes, where either DM annihilates directly with a large branching fraction into light leptons, or, as in the recent models of Arkani-Hamed et al., and of Nomura and Thaler, the annihilation gives low-mass (pseudo)scalars or vectors $\\phi$ which then decay into $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$. While the constraints on the first kind of models have recently been treated by several authors, we study here specifically models of the second type which rely on an efficient Sommerfeld enhancement in order to obtain the necessary boost in the annihilation cross section. We compute the photon flux generated by QED radiative corrections to the decay of $\\phi$ and show that this indeed gives a rather spectacular broad peak in $E^2d\\sigma/dE$, that for these extreme values of the cross section violate gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center for DM density profiles steeper than that of Navarro, Frenk and White. The most stringent constraint comes from the comparison of the predicted synchrotron radiation in the central part of the Galaxy with radio observations of Sgr A*.

The lightcurves during stable accretion show periodicity at the star's frequency and sometimes twice that, due to the presence of two funnel streams that produce antipodal hotspots near the magnetic poles. On the other hand, lightcurves during unstable accretion through tongues penetrating the magnetosphere are more chaotic due to the stochastic behaviour of the tongues, and produce noisier power spectra. However, the power spectra do show some signs of quasi-periodic variability. Most importantly, the rotation frequency of the tongues and the resulting hotspots is close to the inner-disk orbital frequency, except in the most strongly unstable cases. There is therefore a high probability of observing QPOs at that frequency in longer simulations. In addition, the lightcurves in the unstable regime show periodicity at the star's rotation frequency in many of the cases investigated here, again except in the most strongly unstable cases which lack funnel flows and the resulting antipodal hotspots. The noisier power spectra result in the fractional rms amplitudes of the Fourier peaks being smaller.

It is suggested that this should replace the definition of the MOND limit based on the low-acceleration behavior of a Newtonian-MOND interpolating function. In this way, the salient, deep-MOND results--asymptotically flat rotation curves, the mass-rotational-speed relation (baryonic Tully-Fisher relation), the Faber-Jackson relation, etc.--follow from a symmetry principle. For example, asymptotic flatness of rotation curves reflects the fact that radii change under scaling, while velocities do not. I then comment on the interpretation of the deep-MOND limit as one of \"zero mass\": Rest masses, whose presence obstructs scaling symmetry, become negligible compared to the \"phantom\", dynamical masses--those that some would attribute to dark matter. Unlike the former masses, the latter transform in a way that is consistent with the symmetry. Finally, I discuss the putative MOND-cosmology connection in light of another, previously known symmetry of the deep-MOND limit. In particular, it is suggested that MOND is related to the asymptotic de Sitter geometry of our universe. It is conjectured, for example, that in an exact de Sitter cosmos, deep-MOND physics would exactly apply to local systems.

Our primary analysis leads to the conclusion that the host of Jovian planet OGLE-2005-BLG-071Lb is an M dwarf in the foreground disk with mass M= 0.46 +/- 0.04 Msun, distance D_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_LSR ~ 103 km/s. From the best-fit model, the planet has mass M_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 M_Jup, lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 AU from its host and so has an equilibrium temperature of T ~ 55 K, i.e., similar to Neptune.

However, the formation of such high-mass planetary companions in the outer regions of M-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to be unlikely within the core-accretion scenario. There are a number of caveats to this primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) that the unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, that is, the planetary host.

Traces of matrix operators on a light sheet with a compact dimension of size $R$ are interpreted as transverse position operators for macroscopic bodies. An effective quantum wave equation for spacetime is derived from the Matrix Hamiltonian. Its solutions display eigenmodes that connect longitudinal separation and transverse position operators on macroscopic scales. Measurements of transverse relative positions of macroscopically separated bodies, such as signals in Michelson interferometers, are shown to display holographic nonlocality, indeterminacy and noise, whose properties can be predicted with no parameters except $R$. Similar results are derived using a detailed scattering calculation of the matrix wavefunction.

Rotation of the spots leads to high-frequency QPOs. We performed a number of simulation runs for different magnetospheric sizes from small to tiny, and observed a definite correlation between the inner disk radius and the QPO frequency: the frequency is higher when the magnetosphere is smaller. In the stable regime a small magnetosphere forms and accretion through the usual funnel streams is observed, and the frequency of the star is expected to dominate the lightcurve. We performed exploratory investigations of the case in which the magnetosphere becomes negligibly small and the disk interacts with the star through an equatorial belt. We also performed investigation of somewhat larger magnetospheres where one or two ordered tongues may dominate over other chaotic tongues. In application to millisecond pulsars we obtain QPO frequencies in the range of 350 Hz to 990 Hz for one spot. The frequency associated with rotation of one spot may dominate if spots are not identical or antipodal. If the spots are similar and antipodal then the frequencies are twice as high.

Wechsler"], "summary": "A simple, observationally-motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs -- i.e. more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated from N-body simulations. The halo--galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate -- stellar mass relation to z~1. The data demands, for example, that the star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with Mstar~10^{10.0-10.5} Msun from 0<z<1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M~10^{11.5-12.5} Msun. The star formation rate -- halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0<z<1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including 1) a clarification of ``downsizing'', 2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and 3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar build-up of galaxies with Mstar<10^11 Msun at z<1.", "published": "2008-05-22T14:27:37+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-02T14:57:56+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3346v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/620", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/620", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3346v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3346v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.696:620-635,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following: 1) including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z~0 carry errors of ~0.3 dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z~2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level; 2) either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase; 3) conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in the K-band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time; 4) The more plausible assumption of a distribution of stellar metallicities, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can have significant effects on the interpretation of colors blueward of the V-band.

Many lenses with Re around 1-2\" and above 10\" have been reported but very few in between. In this article, we present a sample of 13 strong lensing systems with Re in the range 3\"- 8\", i.e. systems produced by galaxy group scale dark matter haloes, spanning a redshift range from 0.3 to 0.8. This opens a new window of exploration in the mass spectrum, around 10^{13}- 10^{14} M_{sun}, which is a crucial range for understanding the transition between galaxies and galaxy clusters. Our analysis is based on multi-colour CFHTLS images complemented with HST imaging and ground based spectroscopy. Large scale properties are derived from both the light distribution of the elliptical galaxies group members and weak lensing of the faint background galaxy population. On small scales, the strong lensing analysis yields Einstein radii between 2.5\" and 8\". On larger scales, the strong lenses coincide with the peak of the light distribution, suggesting that mass is traced by light. Most of the luminosity maps have complicated shapes, indicating that these intermediate mass structures are dynamically young. Fitting the reduced shear with a Singular Isothermal Sphere, we find sigma ~ 500 km/s and an upper limit of ~900 km/s for the whole sample. The mass to light ratio for the sample is found to be M/L_i ~ 250 (solar units, corrected for evolution), with an upper limit of 500. This can be compared to mass to light ratios of small groups (with sigma ~ 300 km/s and galaxy clusters with sigma > 1000 km/s, thus bridging the gap between these mass scales.", "published": "2008-12-04T21:53:13+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-02T08:44:11+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1033v3", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200811473", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200811473", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1033v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1033v3"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The fraction of exposed pre-main sequence stars with disks is 83% +/- 11%, showing that there is a measurable diskless pre-main sequence population. The sources in each of the Class I and Class II evolutionary states are shown to have very different spatial distributions relative to the distribution of the dense gas in their natal cloud. However, the distribution of nearest neighbor spacings among these two groups of sources are found to be quite similar, with a strong peak at spacings of 0.045 pc.

Shafieloo"], "summary": "It has recently been pointed out by Kowalski et. al. (arxiv:0804.4142) that there is `an unexpected brightness of the SnIa data at z>1'. We quantify this statement by constructing a new statistic which is applicable directly on the Type Ia Supernova (SnIa) distance moduli. This statistic is designed to pick up systematic brightness trends of SnIa datapoints with respect to a best fit cosmological model at high redshifts. It is based on binning the normalized differences between the SnIa distance moduli and the corresponding best fit values in the context of a specific cosmological model (eg LCDM). We then focus on the highest redshift bin and extend its size towards lower redshifts until the Binned Normalized Difference (BND) changes sign (crosses 0) at a redshift z_c (bin size N_c). The bin size N_c of this crossing (the statistical variable) is then compared with the corresponding crossing bin size N_{mc} for Monte Carlo data realizations based on the best fit model. We find that the crossing bin size N_c obtained from the Union08 and Gold06 data with respect to the best fit LCDM model is anomalously large compared to N_{mc} of the corresponding Monte Carlo datasets obtained from the best fit LCDM in each case. In particular, only 2.2% of the Monte Carlo LCDM datasets are consistent with the Gold06 value of N_c while the corresponding probability for the Union08 value of N_c is 5.3%. Thus, according to this statistic, the probability that the high redshift brightness bias of the Union08 and Gold06 datasets is realized in the context of a (w_0,w_1)=(-1,0) model (LCDM cosmology) is less than 6%. The corresponding realization probability in the context of a (w_0,w_1)=(-1.4,2) model is more than 30% for both the Union08 and the Gold06 datasets.", "published": "2008-11-17T21:03:50+00:00", "updated": "2009-06-01T15:24:13+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2802v2", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.79.123502", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.79.123502", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.2802v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.2802v2"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rev.D79:123502,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc", "physics.data-an"]}

We perform a series of 3D adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical simulations that follow both the global evolution on scales of ~20kpc and resolve down to scales ~<10pc with a multiphase atomic interstellar medium (ISM). In this first study, we omit star formation and feedback, and focus on the processes of gravitational instability and cloud collisions and interactions. We define clouds as regions with n_H>=100cm^-3 and track the evolution of individual clouds as they orbit through the galaxy from their birth to their eventual destruction via merger or via destructive collision with another cloud. After ~140Myr a large fraction of the gas in the disk has fragmented into clouds with masses ~10^6 Msun and a mass spectrum similar to that of Galactic GMCs. The disk settles into a quasi steady state in which gravitational scattering of clouds keeps the disk near the threshold of global gravitational instability. The cloud collision time is found to be a small fraction, ~1/5, of the orbital time, and this is an efficient mechanism to inject turbulence into the clouds. This helps to keep clouds only moderately gravitationally bound, with virial parameters of order unity.

Volcanism requires melting of the silicate mantle. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. Here we show that (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3) stagnant lid planets live fast (they have higher rates of melting than their plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution) but die young (melting shuts down after a few Gyr); (4) plate tectonics may not operate on high mass planets because of the production of buoyant crust which is difficult to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient volcanic degassing - volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts, which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to reach the surface.

Our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar activity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models for the lightcurves associated with individual quasar events. In the present work we focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. At all luminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation function is fit well by a single power-law in the range 0.5 < r < 20 h^{-1} Mpc, but its normalization is a strong function of redshift. When we select only quasars with luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasar surveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, in agreement with observations. This holds independently of the assumed lightcurve model, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the Eddington limit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few 10^12 h^{-1} M_sun. Therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used to disentangle lightcurve models, but such a discrimination would become possible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter limits. Overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree rather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxy mergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black hole accretion and quasar activity.", "published": "2008-11-28T21:00:13+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-30T22:43:07+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0003v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14701.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14701.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0003v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.0003v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

However, the entropy of the matter precursors to astrophysical black holes is enormously less than that given by area entropy.

The cosmology recovery depends on the number of image families with known spectroscopic redshifts and the number of stacked clusters. Our simulations suggest that constraints comparable to those derived from other competing established techniques on a constant dark energy equation of state can be obtained using 10 to 40 clusters with 5 or more families of multiple images. We have also studied the observational errors in the image redshifts and positions. We find that spectroscopic redshifts and high resolution {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} images are required to eliminate confidence contour relaxation relative to the ideal case in our simulations. This suggests that the dark energy equation of state, and other cosmological parameters, can be constrained with existing {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} images of lensing clusters coupled with dedicated ground-based arc spectroscopy.", "published": "2006-05-10T15:24:52+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-29T11:08:50+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0605245v6", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14612.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14612.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605245v6", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0605245v6"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Our technique exploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies. Because structure in the universe is built up through galaxy mergers and nearly all galaxies host a central SMBH, some galaxies should possess two SMBHs near their centers as the result of a recent merger. These SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant merger-remnant galaxy, and one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91 exhibit [O III] and Hbeta emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of these, 32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different from the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to velocity offsets of ~50 km/s to ~300 km/s. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O III] emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of velocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of physical models for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most likely explanation is inspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies. Based on this interpretation, we find that roughly half of the red galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger remnants, which implies that mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies. The AGN velocity offsets we find imply a merger fraction of ~30% and a merger rate of ~3 mergers/Gyr for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 < z < 0.82.", "published": "2008-10-19T18:06:44+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-28T22:10:53+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3235v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/956", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/698/1/956", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3235v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.3235v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.698:956-965,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We find that, for the case of a strong ionising field, significant deviations from the non-magnetic evolution are seen when the initial magnetic field threading the globule has an associated magnetic pressure that is greater than one hundred times the gas pressure. In such a strong-field case, the photoevaporating globule will adopt a flattened or \"curled up\" shape, depending on the initial field orientation, and magnetic confinement of the ionised photoevaporation flow can lead to recombination and subsequent fragmentation during advanced stages of the globule evolution. We find suggestive evidence that such magnetic effects may be important in the formation of bright, bar-like emission features in H II regions. We include simple but realistic fits to heating and cooling rates in the neutral and molecular gas in the vicinity of a high-mass star cluster and show that the frequently used isothermal approximation can lead to an overestimate of the importance of gravitational instability in the radiatively imploded globule.

Pe'er"], "summary": "We present a comparative study of the observed properties of the optical and X-ray afterglows of short- and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Using a large sample of 37 short and 421 long GRBs, we find a strong correlation between the afterglow brightness measured after 11 hours and the observed fluence of the prompt emission. Both the optical (R band) and X-ray flux densities (F_R and F_X) scale with the gamma-ray fluence, F_gamma. For bursts with a known redshift, a tight correlation exists between the afterglow flux densities at 11 hours (rest-frame) and the total isotropic gamma-ray energy, Egi: F_{R,X} ~ Egi^{alpha}, with alpha ~ 1. The constant of proportionality is nearly identical for long and short bursts, when Egi is obtained from the Swift data. Additionally, we find that for short busts with F_gamma >10^{-7} erg cm^{-2}, optical afterglows are nearly always detected by reasonably deep early observations. Finally, we show that the ratio F_R/F_X has very similar values for short and long bursts. These results are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard scenario, since they require that either (1) the number density of the surrounding medium of short bursts is typically comparable to, or even larger than the number density of long bursts; (2) short bursts explode into a density profile, n(r)\\alpha r^{-2} or (3) the prompt gamma-ray fluence depends on the density of the external medium. We therefore find it likely that either basic assumptions on the properties of the circumburst environment of short GRBs or else the standard models of GRB emission must be re-examined. We believe that the most likely solution is that the ambient density surrounding typical short bursts is higher than has generally been expected: a typical value of ~1 per cm^{-3} is indicated.", "published": "2008-06-23T03:32:35+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-27T20:32:05+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3607v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/701/1/824", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/701/1/824", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.3607v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3607v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.701:824-836,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

This new approach potentially simplifies the cosmological interpretation.

The proposed scenario involves the presence of a self-sustained turbulence and magnetic field. In the framework of Langevin--Burgers approach the influence of the turbulence is described by an additional external random force in the MHD system. Kinetic equation for the spectral density of the slow magnetosonic (Alfvenic) mode is derived in the short wavelength (WKB) approximation. The results show a pressing need for conduction of numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a random driver to take into account the influence of the long wavelength modes and to give a more precise analytical assessment of the short ones. Realistic MC calculations for the heating rate and shear stress tensor should give an answer to the perplexing problem for the missing viscosity in accretion disks and reveal why the quasars are the most powerful sources of light in the universe. The planned MC calculations can be incorporated in global models for accretion disks and also in all other physical conditions where there is a shear flow in a magnetized turbulent plasma. It is supposed that the heating mechanism by Alfven waves absorption is common for many kinds of space plasmas from solar corona to active galactic nuclei and the solution of these longstanding puzzles deserves active interdisciplinary research.

Indeed progress in the study of large scale structures and galaxy formation would have been very limited without this tool. For nearly twenty years the limitations imposed by computing power forced simulators to ignore some of the basic requirements for modeling gravitational instability. One of the limitations of most cosmological codes has been the use of a force softening length that is much smaller than the typical inter-particle separation. This leads to departures from collisionless evolution that is desired in these simulations. We propose a particle based method with an adaptive resolution where the force softening length is reduced in high density regions while ensuring that it remains well above the local inter-particle separation. The method, called the Adaptive TreePM, is based on the TreePM code. We present the mathematical model and an implementation of this code, and demonstrate that the results converge over a range of options for parameters introduced in generalizing the code from the TreePM code. We explicitly demonstrate collisionless evolution in collapse of an oblique plane wave. We compare the code with the fixed resolution TreePM code and also an implementation that mimics adaptive mesh refinement methods and comment on the agreement, and disagreements in the results. We find that in most respects the ATreePM code performs at least as well as the fixed resolution TreePM in highly over-dense regions, from clustering and number density of haloes, to internal dynamics of haloes.

Schnittman"], "summary": "The association of an electromagnetic signal with the merger of a pair of supermassive black holes would have many important implications. For example, it would provide new information about gas and magnetic field interactions in dynamical spacetimes as well as a combination of redshift and luminosity distance that would enable precise cosmological tests. A proposal first made by Bode & Phinney (2007) is that because radiation of gravitational waves during the final inspiral and merger of the holes is abrupt and decreases the mass of the central object by a few percent, there will be waves in the disk that can steepen into shocks and thus increase the disk luminosity in a characteristic way. We evaluate this process analytically and numerically. We find that shocks only occur when the fractional mass loss exceeds the half-thickness (h/r) of the disk, hence significant energy release only occurs for geometrically thin disks which are thus at low Eddington ratios. This strongly limits the effective energy release, and in fact our simulations show that the natural variations in disk luminosity are likely to obscure this effect entirely. However, we demonstrate that the reduction of luminosity caused by the retreat of the inner edge of the disk following mass loss is potentially detectable. This decrease occurs even if the disk is geometrically thick, and lasts for a duration on the order of the viscous time of the modified disk. Observationally, the best prospect for detection would be a sensitive future X-ray instrument with a field of view of on the order of a square degree, or possibly a wide-field radio array such as the Square Kilometer Array, if the disk changes produce or interrupt radio emission from a jet.", "published": "2008-12-30T18:32:51+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-26T20:00:32+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4874v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/859", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/700/1/859", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4874v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4874v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.700:859-871,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We point out that several astrophysical experiments are now reaching sensitivities that allow them to explore supersymmetric unified theories. In these theories the electroweak-mass DM particle can decay, just like the proton, through dimension six operators with lifetime ~ 10^26 sec. Interestingly, this timescale is now being investigated in several experiments including ATIC, PAMELA, HESS, and Fermi. Positive evidence for such decays may be opening our first direct window to physics at the supersymmetric unification scale of M_GUT ~ 10^16 GeV, as well as the TeV scale. Moreover, in the same supersymmetric unified theories, dimension five operators can lead a weak-scale superparticle to decay with a lifetime of ~ 100 sec. Such decays are recorded by a change in the primordial light element abundances and may well explain the present discord between the measured Li abundances and standard big bang nucleosynthesis, opening another window to unification.

The variance of the effect depends on the subhalo mass function, scaling as the product of the substructure mass fraction and a characteristic mass of subhalos (namely <m^2>/<m>). Time delay perturbations therefore complement gravitational lens flux ratio anomalies and astrometric perturbations by measuring a different moment of the subhalo mass function. Unlike flux ratio anomalies, \"time delay millilensing\" is unaffected by dust extinction or stellar microlensing in the lens galaxy. Furthermore, we show that time delay ratios are immune to the radial profile degeneracy that usually plagues lens modeling. We lay out a mathematical theory of time delay perturbations and find it to be tractable and attractive.

Using simulations of the Clover experiment, we compare the ability of modulated and un-modulated observations to recover the signature of gravitational waves in the polarized CMB sky in the presence of a number of anticipated systematic effects. The general expectations that fast modulation is helpful in mitigating low-frequency detector noise, and that the additional redundancy in the projection of the instrument's polarization sensitivity directions onto the sky when modulating reduces the impact of instrumental polarization, are borne out by our simulations. Neither low-frequency polarized atmospheric fluctuations nor systematic errors in the polarization sensitivity directions are mitigated by modulation. Additionally, we find no significant reduction in the effect of pointing errors by modulation. For a Clover-like experiment, pointing jitter should be negligible but any systematic mis-calibration of the polarization coordinate reference system results in significant E-B mixing on all angular scales and will require careful control. We also stress the importance of combining data from multiple detectors in order to remove the effects of common-mode systematics (such as 1/f atmospheric noise) on the measured polarization signal. Finally we compare the performance of our simulated experiment with the predicted performance from a Fisher analysis.

We have discovered two groups of remarkably aligned molecular clouds at |b|~1--5 degree in the two regions. In SS433, we have detected 10 clouds in total, which are well aligned nearly along the axis of the X-ray jet emanating from SS433. These clouds have similar line-of-sight velocities of 42--56 km s^-1 and the total projected length of the feature is ~300 pc, three times larger than that of the X-ray jet, at a distance of 3 kpc. Towards l~348.5 degree, we have detected four clouds named as MJG348.5 at line-of-sight velocities of -80 -- -95 km s^-1 in V_LSR, which also show alignment nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The total length of the feature is ~400 pc at a kinematic distance of 6 kpc. In the both cases, the CO clouds are distributed at high galactic latitudes where such clouds are very rare. In addition, their alignments and coincidence in velocity should be even rarer, suggesting that they are physically associated. We tested a few possibilities to explain these clouds, including protostellar outflows, supershells, and interactions with energetic jets. Among them, a favorable scenario is that the interaction between relativistic jet and the interstellar medium induced the formation of molecular clouds over the last ~10^5-6 yrs. It is suggested that the timescale of the relativistic jet may be considerably larger, in the order of 10^5-6 yrs, than previously thought in SS433.

The idea is that the degrees of freedom necessary to describe the interior of the cosmic horizon of one observer in a given universe are in fact sufficient to account for the physics of that entire universe: the remainder is just a set of redundant copies of the interior of a single cosmic horizon. These copies must be factored out, just as one has to factor out gauge redundancies to identify the true degrees of freedom in gauge theory. Motivated by the observation that quantum cosmology favours compactified negatively curved spatial sections, we propose to use such geometries to implement horizon complementarity for eternal Inflation. We point out that the \"effective finiteness\" of such universes has important consequences for physics inside the observer's horizon: there is a non-local effect, represented by a Casimir energy.

In calculating the dynamics of this star cluster and gas ring system, we include the effects of dynamical friction of the background stars in the host galaxy on the star cluster, and inflowing gas along the bar onto the nuclear ring at the two contact points. We show that the final separation is of the order of the Hill radius of the nuclear ring, which is typically 20-30% of its radius. Massive star clusters can reach half of this separation very quickly and produce a factor of a few enhancement in the gas surface density. If this leads to star formation in addition to the (ongoing) formation of star clusters near the contact points, a possible (initial) azimuthal age gradient may become diluted or even disappear.

Clusters are expected to emit gamma rays as a result of (1) a population of high-energy primary and re-accelerated secondary cosmic rays (CR) fueled by structure formation and merger shocks, active galactic nuclei and supernovae, and (2) particle dark matter (DM) annihilation. In this paper, we ask the question of whether the Fermi telescope will be able to discriminate between the two emission processes. We present data-driven predictions for a large X-ray flux limited sample of galaxy clusters and groups. We point out that the gamma ray signals from CR and DM can be comparable. In particular, we find that poor clusters and groups are the systems predicted to have the highest DM to CR emission at gamma-ray energies. Based on detailed Fermi simulations, we study observational handles that might enable us to distinguish the two emission mechanisms, including the gamma-ray spectra, the spatial distribution of the signal and the associated multi-wavelength emissions. We also propose optimal hardness ratios, which will help to understand the nature of the gamma-ray emission. Our study indicates that gamma rays from DM annihilation with a high particle mass can be distinguished from a CR spectrum even for fairly faint sources. Discriminating a CR spectrum from a light DM particle will be instead much more difficult, and will require long observations and/or a bright source.

The sodium abundances corrected from NLTE are found to be about solar. [Na/Fe] shows a slight increase of 0.10 dex as a function of stellar mass in the 1.8 to 3.2 Msun range covered by our sample, in agreement with standard first dredge-up predictions. Our results do not support previous claims of sodium overabundances as high as +0.60 dex. An anti-correlation between 12C/13C and turn-off mass is identified and interpreted as being caused by a post-bump thermohaline mixing. Moreover, we find low 12C/13C ratios in a few intermediate-mass early-AGB stars, confirming that an extra-mixing process also operates in stars that do not experienced the RGB bump. In this case, the extra-mixing possibly acts on the early-AGB, in agreement with theoretical expectations for thermohaline mixing.

These objects thus appear to be significantly older and more massive than LAEs at high-redshift. We also find that these LAEs show a mild trend towards higher metallicity than those at high redshift, as well as a tighter range of dust attenuation and interstellar medium geometry.

Likelihood and Bayesian estimation are applied to a local non-linear perturbed model up to third order, characterized by a linear term which is described by a Gaussian N-pdf, and a second and third order terms which are proportional to the square and the cube of the linear one. We also explore a set of model selection techniques (the Akaike and the Bayesian Information Criteria, the minimum description length, the Bayesian Evidence and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test) and their application to decide whether a given data set is better described by the proposed local non-Gaussian model, rather than by the standard Gaussian temperature distribution. As an application, we consider the analysis of the WMAP 5-year data at a resolution of around 2 degrees. At this angular scale (the Sachs-Wolfe regime), the non-Gaussian description proposed in this work defaults (under certain conditions) to an approximative local form of the weak non-linear coupling inflationary model (e.g. Komatsu & Spergel 2001) previously addressed in the literature. For this particular case, we obtain an estimation for the non-linear coupling parameter of -94 < F_nl < 154 at 95% CL. Equally, model selection criteria also indicate that the Gaussian hypothesis is favored against the particular local non-Gaussian model proposed in this work. This result is in agreement with previous findings obtained for equivalent non-Gaussian models and with different non-Gaussian estimators. However, our estimator based on the N-pdf is more efficient than previous estimators and, therefore, provides tighter constraints on the coupling parameter at degree angular resolution.", "published": "2008-12-09T17:32:39+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-21T09:22:33+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1756v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14974.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14974.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1756v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1756v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Applying the filament-finding algorithm based on the minimal spanning tree (MST) technique to the Millennium voids, we identify the mini-filaments running through voids and measure their sizes at each redshift. Then, we calculate the comoving number density of void filaments as a function of their sizes in the logarithmic interval and determine an analytic fitting function for it. It is found that the size distribution of void mini-filaments in the logarithmic interval has an almost universal shape, insensitive to the redshift: In the short-size section it is well approximated as a power-law, while in the long-size section it decreases exponentially.

We investigate here, using numerical simulations, how this released energy and other related quantities (notably the binding energy and size of the virialized structure) depends on the initial conditions, for the one parameter family of starting configurations given by randomly distributing N cold particles in a spherical volume. Previous studies have established that the minimal size reached by the system scales approximately as N^{-1/3}, a behaviour which follows trivially when the growth of perturbations (which regularize the singularity of the cold collapse in the infinite N limit) are assumed to be unaffected by the boundaries. Our study shows that the energy ejected grows approximately in proportion to N^{1/3}, while the fraction of the initial mass ejected grows only very slowly with N, approximately logarithmically, in the range of N simulated. We examine in detail the mechanism of this mass and energy ejection, showing explicitly that it arises from the interplay of the growth of perturbations with the finite size of the system. A net lag of particles compared to their uniform spherical collapse trajectories develops first at the boundaries and then propagates into the volume during the collapse. Particles in the outer shells are then ejected as they scatter through the time dependent potential of an already re-expanding central core.

This approach gives an alternative measure for assessing the impact of future experiments, as compared with the large body of literature that compares experiments in abstract parameter spaces and more recent work that evaluates the constraining power of experiments on individual parameter spaces of specific quintessence models. We use the Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) models of future data sets, and compare the discriminative power of experiments designated by the DETF as Stages 2, 3, and 4. Our work reveals a minimal increase in discriminating power when comparing Stage 3 to Stage 2, but a very striking increase in discriminating power when going to Stage 4. We also see evidence that even modest improvements over DETF Stage 4 could result in even more dramatic discriminating power among quintessence dark energy models. We develop and demonstrate the technique of using the independently measured modes of the equation of state as a common parameter space in which to compare the different quintessence models, and we argue that this technique is a powerful one. We use the PNGB, Exponential, Albrecht-Skordis, and Inverse Tracker (or Inverse Power Law) quintessence models for this work.

We use the minimal parity-symmetric extension of the standard model, which implies that the microphysics is the same in the two sectors. We find that the mass-radius relation is significantly modified in the presence of a few percent mirror baryons. This effect mimics that of other exotica, e.g., quark matter. In contrast to the common view that the neutron-star equilibrium sequence is unique, we show that it depends on the relative number of mirror baryons to ordinary baryons. It is therefore history dependent. The critical mass for core collapse, i.e., the process by which neutron stars are created, is modified in the presence of mirror baryons.

We focus on the dependence of numerical results on the gas temperature Tout supplied from the outer region. General relativistic effects are taken into account using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. We ignore the radiative cooling of the accreting gas. The initial state is a torus whose density maximum is at 35rs or 50rs from the gravitating center, where rs is the Schwarzschild radius. The torus is initially threaded by a weak azimuthal magnetic field. We found that mass accretion rate and the mass outflow rate strongly depend on the temperature of the initial torus. The ratio of the average Maxwell stress generated by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) to gas pressure is alpha ~0.05 in the hot torus and alpha ~ 0.01 in the cool torus. In the cool model, a constant angular momentum inner torus is formed around 4-8rs. This inner torus deforms itself from a circle to a crescent quasi-periodically. During this deformation, the mass accretion rate, the magnetic energy and the Maxwell stress increase. As the magnetic energy is released, the inner torus returns to a circular shape and starts the next cycle. Power spectral density (PSD) of the time variation of the mass accretion rate in the cool model has a low frequency peak around 10Hz when we assumed a 10 solar mass black hole. The PSD of the hot model is flat in 1-30Hz. The slope of the PSD in the cool model is steeper than that in the hot model in 30-100Hz.

Previous attempts to measure robust temperatures at cluster virial radii failed. Aims: The goal of this work is to measure the temperature profile of the very relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2204 out to large radii, possibly reaching the virial radius. Methods: Taking advantage of its low particle background due to its low-Earth orbit, Suzaku data are used to measure the outer temperature profile of Abell 2204. These data are combined with Chandra and XMM-Newton data of the same cluster in order to make the connection to the inner regions, unresolved by Suzaku, and to determine the smearing due to Suzaku's PSF. Results: The temperature profile of Abell 2204 is determined from 10 kpc to 1800 kpc, close to an estimate of r200 (the approximation to the virial radius). The temperature rises steeply from below 4 keV in the very center up to more than 8 keV in the intermediate range and then decreases again to about 4 keV at the largest radii. Varying the measured particle background normalization artificially by +-10 percent does not change the results significantly. Predictions for outer temperature profiles based on hydrodynamic simulations show good agreement. In particular, we find the observed temperature profile to be slightly steeper but consistent with a drop of a factor of 0.6 from 0.3 r200 to r200, as predicted by simulations. Conclusions: Temperature measurements up to the virial radius seem feasible with Suzaku, when a careful analysis of the different background components and the effects of the PSF is performed.

Understanding dark energy has become the central problem of modern cosmology. After describing the scientific background in depth, we formulate the task as a nonlinear inverse problem that expresses the comoving distance function in terms of the dark-energy equation of state. We present two classes of methods for making sharp statistical inferences about the equation of state from observations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe). First, we derive a technique for testing hypotheses about the equation of state that requires no assumptions about its form and can distinguish among competing theories. Second, we present a framework for computing parametric and nonparametric estimators of the equation of state, with an associated assessment of uncertainty. Using our approach, we evaluate the strength of statistical evidence for various competing models of dark energy. Consistent with current studies, we find that with the available Type Ia SNe data, it is not possible to distinguish statistically among popular dark-energy models, and that, in particular, there is no support in the data for rejecting a cosmological constant.

We discuss whether this displays features that could have a physical meaning in terms of the proposed QPO models. METHOD: We consider the difference in rms amplitude between the upper and lower kHz QPOs, as a function of the frequency ratio R. We compare two data sets. Set I is a collection taken from published data. Set II has rms amplitude values obtained by automatic fitting of continuous segments of RXTE-PCA observations. RESULTS: For each of the six sources, we find that there is a point in the R domain around which the amplitudes of the two twin kHz QPOs are the same. We find such a point located inside a narrow interval R=1.5 +-3%. Further investigation is needed in the case of two sources to explore this finding, since we have not determined this point in Set II. There is evidence of a similar point close to R = 1.33 or R = 1.25 in the four sources. We suggest that some of these points may correspond to the documented clustering of the twin kHz QPO frequency ratios. CONCLUSIONS: For the sources studied, the rms amplitudes of the two kHz peaks become equal when the frequencies of the oscillations pass through a certain ratio R, which is roughly the same for each of the sources. In terms of the orbital QPO models, with some assumptions concerning the QPO modulation, this finding implies the existence of a specific orbit at a common value of the dimensionless radius, at which the oscillations corresponding to the two peaks come into balance. In a more general context, the amplitude difference behaviour suggests the possible existence of an energy interchange between the upper and lower QPO modes.", "published": "2008-12-27T22:11:36+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-17T22:29:21+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4751v2", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/20079026", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/20079026", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4751v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4751v2"], "journal_reference": "Astron.Astrophys.497:661-665,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Since EGRET observation is taken as a normalization, this prediction is independent of the particle physics property of dark matter. The uncertainties of the prediction are discussed in detail. We find that the major uncertainty comes from the mass function of subhaloes, i.e., whether the subhaloes are \"point like\" (high-mass rich) or \"diffuse like\" (low-mass rich).

However the dynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a super-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a powerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a thick disk.

Externally, these fields have a strong dipolar component, while their internal structure and evolution are uncertain, but highly relevant for several problems in stellar and high-energy astrophysics. We discuss the main properties expected for the stable magnetic configurations in these stars from physical arguments, and how these properties may determine the modes of decay of these configurations. Stable magneto-hydrostatic equilibria are likely to exist in stars whenever the matter in their interior is stably stratified (not barotropic). These equilibria are not force-free and not required to satisfy the Grad-Shafranov equation, but they do involve both toroidal and poloidal field components. We argue that the main mode of decay for these configurations are processes that lift the constraints set by stable stratification, such as heat diffusion in main-sequence envelopes and white dwarfs, and beta decays or particle diffusion in neutron stars. In the former, heat diffusion is not fast enough to make these equilibria evolve over the stellar lifetime. In neutron stars, a strong enough field might decay by overcoming the compositional stratification through beta decays (at the highest field strengths) or through ambipolar diffusion (for somewhat weaker fields). These processes convert magnetic energy to thermal energy, and they occur at significant rates only once the latter is smaller than the former, and therefore they substantially delay the cooling of the neutron star, while slowly decreasing its magnetic energy.", "published": "2008-09-02T12:36:42+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-15T16:49:31+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0361v3", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200810895", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200810895", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0361v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0361v3"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Subsequent observations showed that this EDIG (extended or extraplanar diffuse interstellar gas) has rotation velocities approximately 10-20% lower than those in the central plane, and have been hard to account for. Here we present results of hydrodynamic models, with radiative cooling and heating from star formation. We find that in models with star formation generated stochastically across the disc an extraplanar gas layer is generated as long as the star formation is sufficiently strong. However, this gas rotates at nearly the same speed as the mid-plane gas. We then studied a range of models with imposed spiral or bar waves in the disc. EDIG layers were also generated in these models, but primarily over the wave regions, not over the entire disc. Because of this partial coverage, the EDIG clouds move radially, as well as vertically, with the result that observed kinematic anomalies are reproduced. The implication is that the kinematic anomalies are the result of three-dimensional motions when the cylindrical symmetry of the disc is broken. Thus, the kinematic anomalies are the result of bars or strong waves, and more face-on galaxies with such waves should have an asymmetric EDIG component. The models also indicate that the EDIG can contain a significant fraction of cool gas, and that some star formation can be triggered at considerable heights above the disc midplane.

Lokas", "Stelios Kazantzidis", "Lucio Mayer", "Gary A. Mamon"], "summary": "We conduct high-resolution collisionless N-body simulations to investigate the tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies on an eccentric orbit in the Milky Way (MW) potential. The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness stellar disk embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10 Gyr of dynamical evolution and after 5 pericentre passages the dwarfs suffer substantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major morphological transformation from a disk to a bar and finally to a spheroid. The bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is transferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via gradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive quantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation mechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We compare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disk and find that the evolution is fastest when the disk is coplanar with the orbit. Despite the strong tidal perturbations and mass loss the dwarfs remain dark matter dominated. For most of the time the 1D stellar velocity dispersion, \\sigma, follows the maximum circular velocity, V_{\\rm max}, and they are both good tracers of the bound mass. Specifically, we find that M_{\\rm bound} \\propto V_{\\rm max}^{3.5} and V_{\\rm max} \\sim \\sqrt{3} \\sigma in agreement with earlier studies based on pure dark matter simulations. The latter relation is based on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf and may thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dSphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellites problem.", "published": "2008-03-17T15:20:09+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-14T13:03:11+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2464v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15046.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15046.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2464v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.2464v2"], "journal_reference": "Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc. 397 (2009) 2015-2029", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Shocks enhance gas density and sufficiently dense regions may become self gravitating. Potential star forming clouds within larger molecular clouds, move randomly at supersonic speeds. Depending on the precollision velocity, colliding molecular clouds produce a slab that is either shock compressed or pressure confined. In a sequel of two papers (I & II), we simulate molecular cloud collision and investigate the dynamical evolution of such slabs. Shocked slabs are susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities and in the present paper (I) we study the effect of strong shear between slab layers on the dynamic evolution of a shock compressed gas slab. Both, head-on and off-centre cloud collisions have been examined in this work. We include self gravity in all our simulations. Simulations presented here, are performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical scheme. Individual, pre-collision clouds are modelled as pressure confined Bonnor-Ebert spheres. However, in the interest of brevity the thermodynamic details of the problem are simplified and the gas temperature is simply evolved by a barytropic equation of state.

Atmospheric circulation models are being developed to study these new regimes but model validations and intercomparisons are needed to establish their consistency and accuracy. To this end, we present a simple Earth-like validation of the pseudo-spectral solver of meteorological equations called IGCM (Intermediate General Circulation Model), based on Newtonian relaxation to a prescribed latitudinal profile of equilibrium temperatures. We then describe a straightforward and idealized model extension to the atmospheric flow on a hot Jupiter with the same IGCM solver. This shallow, three-dimensional hot Jupiter model is based on Newtonian relaxation to a permanent day-night pattern of equilibrium temperatures and the absence of surface drag. The baroclinic regime of the Earth's lower atmosphere is contrasted with the more barotropic regime of the simulated hot Jupiter flow. For plausible conditions at the 0.1-1 bar pressure level on HD 209458b, the simulated flow is characterized by unsteadiness, subsonic wind speeds, a zonally-perturbed superrotating equatorial jet and large scale polar vortices.

This enables us to \\emph{coherently} search for all three stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes using a single template bank. Taking our motivation from these results, we propose a family of template waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes that follow quasi-circular inspiral.

This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies, and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter, and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics, and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhalos when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores.

We inject kinetic energy along with kinetic helicity in spherical domains via helical forcing using Chandrasekhar-Kendall functions. We take perfect conductor boundary conditions for the magnetic field to ensure that no magnetic helicity escapes the domain boundaries. We find dynamo action giving rise to magnetic fields at scales larger than the characteristic scale of the forcing. The magnetic energy exceeds the kinetic energy over dissipative time scales, similar to that seen earlier in Cartesian simulations in periodic boxes. As we increase the size of the domain in the azimuthal direction we find that the nonlinearly saturated magnetic field organizes itself in long-lived cellular structures with aspect ratios close to unity. These structures tile the domain along the azimuthal direction, thus resulting in very small longitudinally averaged magnetic fields for large domain sizes. The scales of these structures are determined by the smallest scales of the domain, which in our simulations is usually the radial scale. We also find that increasing the meridional extent of the domains produces little qualitative change, except a marginal increase in the large-scale field.

These jets transport the energy from the collapsed core to large distances, where it is dissipated in the form of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. In this paper we study the dynamics of ultrarelativistic jets produced in collapsars. Also we extrapolate our results to infer the angular energy distribution of the produced outflows in the afterglow phase. Our main focus is to look for global energetical properties which can be imprinted by the different structure of different progenitor stars. Thus, we employ a number of pre-supernova, stellar models (with distinct masses and metallicities), and inject in all of them jets with fixed initial conditions. We assume that at the injection nozzle, the jet is mildly relativistic (Lorentz factor $\\sim 5$), has a finite half-opening angle ($5^\\circ$), and carries a power of $10^{51} $erg s$^{-1}$. These jets arrive intact to the stellar surface and break out of it. A large Lorentz factor region $\\Gamma\\simmore 100$ develops well before the jet reaches the surface of the star, in the unshocked part of the beam, located between the injection nozzle and the first recollimation shock. These high values of $\\Gamma$ are possible because the finite opening angle of the jet allows for free expansion towards the radial direction. We find a strong correlation between the angular energy distribution of the jet, after its eruption from the progenitor surface, and the mass of the progenitors. The angular energy distribution of the jets from light progenitor models is steeper than that of the jets injected in more massive progenitor stars.

The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades.

We find that there exists a characteristic scale where the properties of galaxies suddenly start to depend on the clustercentric radius at fixed neighbor environment. The characteristic scale is $1\\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxy luminosity. Existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxy number density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relation in clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentric radius and has no discontinuity in general. What is really working in clusters is the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, where the neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local mass density attributed to the neighbor. The morphology-density relation appears working only because of the statistical correlation between the nearest neighbor distance and the local galaxy number density. We find strong evidence that the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early-type galaxies is the main drive to quenching star formation activity of late-type galaxies in clusters. The hot cluster gas seems to play at most a minor role down to one tenth of the cluster virial radius. We also find that the viable mechanisms which can account for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internal kinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with the cluster potential.

We repeat the previous hydrodynamical star cluster formation simulations of Bate et al., and Bate & Bonnell, but we use a realistic gas equation of state and radiative transfer in the flux-limited diffusion approximation rather than the original barotropic equation of state. Whereas star formation in the barotropic simulations continued unabated until the simulation was stopped, we find that radiative feedback essentially terminates the production of new objects after roughly one local dynamical time. Radiative feedback also dramatically decreases the propensity of massive circumstellar discs to fragment and inhibits fragmentation of other dense gas (e.g. filaments) close to existing protostellar objects. These two effects decrease the numbers of protostars formed by a factor of approximately 4. Whereas the original simulations produced more brown dwarfs than stars, the radiative feedback results in a ratio of stars to brown dwarfs of approximately 5:1, in much better agreement with observations. Most importantly, we find that although the characteristic stellar mass in the original calculations scaled linearly with the initial mean Jeans mass, when radiative feedback is included the characteristic stellar mass is indistinguishable for the two calculations. We thus propose that the reason the observed initial mass function appears to be universal is due to self-regulation of the star formation process by radiative feedback. We present an analytic argument showing how a characteristic mass may be derived that is relatively independent of initial conditions such as the cloud's density.

Each binary radiates power exclusively in modes with frequencies that are integer-linear-combinations of the orbit's three fundamental frequencies. The following general spectral properties are found with a survey of orbits: (i) 99% of the radiated power is typically carried by a few hundred modes, and at most by about a thousand modes, (ii) the dominant frequencies can be grouped into a small number of families defined by fixing two of the three integer frequency multipliers, and (iii) the specifics of these trends can be qualitatively inferred from the geometry of the orbit under consideration. Detections using triperiodic analytic templates modeled on these general properties would constitute a verification of radiation from an adiabatic sequence of black hole orbits and would recover the evolution of the fundamental orbital frequencies. In an analogy with ordinary spectroscopy, this would compare to observing the Bohr model's atomic hydrogen spectrum without being able to rule out alternative atomic theories or nuclei. The suitability of such a detection technique is demonstrated using snapshots computed at 12-hour intervals throughout the last three years before merger of a kludged inspiral. Because of circularization, the number of excited modes decreases as the binary evolves.

The aim here is to provide a complementary strategy for planet search in such a dense environment. The polarization properties of SiO masers, especially their circular polarization, are, under certain conditions, good tracers for rapid magnetospheric events. A Jovian planet with a magnetosphere whose dipole axis is misaligned with its rotation axis, naturally provides such conditions. Here I present several models showing that the polarization will be periodically modulated. Single-dish monitoring with a sufficiently dense time sampling and a carefully calibrated polarimeter, in combination with VLBI observations, are suited to detect and locate a periodic modulation of the circular maser polarization due to a precessing Jovian magnetosphere. The phenomenon will be rare, because a favourable arrangement of maser and magnetosphere is needed, otherwise the polarization may be below the detection threshold, especially if the maser is unsaturated. Linear polarization, though exhibiting a qualitatively similar modulation, is likely to suffer more from confusion due to beam dilution, even in VLBI observations.", "published": "2008-09-01T11:49:27+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-06T13:46:23+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0214v3", "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/200811537", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/200811537", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0214v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0214v3"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The numbers and properties of HCSSs contain information about the merger histories of galaxies, the late evolution of binary black holes, and the distribution of gravitational-wave kicks. We relate the structural properties of HCSSs to the properties of their host galaxies, in two regimes: collisional, i.e. short nuclear relaxation times; and collisionless, i.e. long nuclear relaxtion times. HCSSs are expected to be similar in size and luminosity to globular clustersbut in extreme cases their stellar mass can approach that of UCDs. However they differ from all other classes of compact stellar system in having very high internal velocities. We show that the kick velocity is encoded in the velocity dispersion of the bound stars. Given a large enough sample of HCSSs, the distribution of gravitational-wave kicks can therefore be empirically determined. We combine a hierarchical merger algorithm with stellar population models to compute the rate of production of HCSSs over time and the probability of observing HCSSs in the local universe as a function of their apparent magnitude, color, size and velocity dispersion, under two assumptions about the star formation history prior to the kick. We predict that roughly 100 should be detectable within 2 Mpc of the center of the Virgo cluster and that many of these should be bright enough that their high internal velocity dispersions could be measured with reasonable exposure times.", "published": "2008-09-29T19:14:39+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-05T21:33:05+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.5046v3", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/1690", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/1690", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.5046v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.5046v3"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.699:1690-1710,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Hui"], "summary": "Galaxy-galaxy or galaxy-quasar lensing can provide important information on the mass distribution in the Universe. It consists of correlating the lensing signal (either shear or magnification) of a background galaxy/quasar sample with the number density of a foreground galaxy sample. However, the foreground galaxy density is inevitably altered by the magnification bias due to the mass between the foreground and the observer, leading to a correction to the observed galaxy-lensing signal. The aim of this paper is to quantify this correction. The single most important determining factor is the foreground redshift z: the correction is small if the foreground galaxies are at low redshifts but can become non-negligible for sufficiently high redshifts. For instance, we find that for the multipole l=1000, the correction is above 1%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.37, and above 5%*(5s-2)/b for z<0.67, where s is the number count slope of the foreground sample, and b its galaxy bias. These considerations are particularly important for geometrical measures, such as the Jain and Taylor ratio or its generalization by Zhang et al. Assuming (5s-2)/b=1, we find that the foreground redshift should be limited to z<0.45 in order to avoid biasing the inferred dark energy equation of state w by more than 5%, and that even for a low foreground redshift (< 0.45), the background samples must be well separated from the foreground to avoid incurring a bias of similar magnitude. Lastly, we briefly comment on the possibility of obtaining these geometrical measures without using galaxy shapes, using instead magnification bias itself.", "published": "2008-09-18T15:53:47+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-05T18:42:34+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3101v2", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123517", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123517", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3101v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3101v2"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rev.D78:123517,2008", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We follow them in considering a supersonic phase transition and using a simplified equation of state, but our calculations are general relativistic (using 2D simulations in the conformally flat approximation) as compared with their 3D Newtonian treatment. We also improved the treatment of the initial phase transformation, avoiding the introduction of artificial convection. As before, we find that the emitted gravitational-wave spectrum is dominated by the fundamental quasi-radial and quadrupolar pulsation modes but the strain amplitudes are much smaller than suggested previously, which is disappointing for the detection prospects. However, we see significantly smaller damping and observe a nonlinear mode resonance which substantially enhances the emission in some cases. We explain the damping mechanisms operating, giving a different view from the previous work. Finally, we discuss the detectability of the gravitational waves, showing that the signal-to-noise ratio for current or second generation interferometers could be high enough to detect such events in our Galaxy, although third generation detectors would be needed to observe them out to the Virgo cluster, which would be necessary for having a reasonable event rate.", "published": "2008-06-10T16:22:38+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-05T08:36:15+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1700v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14056.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.14056.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.1700v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.1700v2"], "journal_reference": "Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.394:52-76,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "gr-qc"]}

Piro", "E. Quataert"], "summary": "A white dwarf (WD) approaching the Chandrasekhar mass may in several cases undergo accretion-induced collapse (AIC) to a neutron star (NS) before a thermonuclear explosion ensues. It has generally been assumed that AIC does not produce a detectable supernova (SN). If, however, the progenitor WD is rapidly rotating (as may be expected due to its prior accretion), a centrifugally supported disk forms around the NS upon collapse. We calculate the subsequent evolution of this accretion disk using time-dependent height-integrated simulations with initial conditions taken from the AIC calculations of Dessart et al. (2006). Initially, the disk is cooled by neutrinos and its composition is driven neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) by electron captures. However, as the disk viscously spreads, it is irradiated by neutrinos from the central proto-NS, which dramatically alters its neutron-to-proton ratio. We find that electron neutrino captures increase Ye to ~ 0.5 by the time that weak interactions in the disk freeze out. Because the disk becomes radiatively inefficient and begins forming alpha-particles soon after freeze out, powerful winds blow away most of the disk's remaining mass. These Ye ~ 0.5 outflows synthesize up to a few times 1e-2 Msun in 56Ni. As a result, AIC may be accompanied by a radioactively powered SN-like transient that peaks on a timescale of ~ 1 day. Since few intermediate mass elements are likely synthesized, these Ni-rich explosions should be spectroscopically distinct from other SNe. PanSTARRs and the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC transients per year if their true rate is ~1/100 of the Type Ia rate, and LSST should detect hundreds per year. High cadence observations (< 1 day) are optimal for the detection and follow-up of AIC (abridged).", "published": "2008-12-18T21:00:04+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-05T01:51:51+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3656v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14909.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14909.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3656v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3656v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Removal of polarized Galactic emission is a difficult part of any 21 cm EoR program, and we present new upper limits to diffuse polarized foregrounds at 150 MHz. We find no high significance evidence of polarized emission in our observed field at mid galactic latitude (J2000 08h26m+26). We find an upper limit on the 2-dimensional angular power spectrum of diffuse polarized foregrounds of [l^2 C_l/(2 PI)]^{1/2}< 3K in frequency bins of width 1 MHz at 300<l<1000. The 3-dimensional power spectrum of polarized emission, which is most directly relevant to EoR observations, is [k^3 P_p(k)/(2 PI^2)]^{1/2}< 2K at k_perp > 0.03 h/Mpc, k < 0.1 h/Mpc. This can be compared to the expected EoR signal in total intensity of [k^3 P(k)/ (2 PI^2) ]^{1/2} ~ 10 mK. We find polarized structure is substantially weaker than suggested by extrapolation from higher frequency observations, so the new low upper limits reported here reduce the anticipated impact of these foregrounds on EoR experiments. We discuss Faraday beam and depth depolarization models and compare predictions of these models to our data. We report on a new technique for polarization calibration using pulsars, as well as a new technique to remove broadband radio frequency interference.

The dynamics of the collapse of the halo is governed by the form of the quintessence potential, the time evolution of its equation of state, the initial conditions of the field and its homogeneity nature in the highly non--linear regime. These have a direct impact on the turnaround, virialisation and collapse times, altering in consequence the non--linear density contrast and virial radius. We compute halo concentrations using the Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz algorithm, examining two extreme scenarios: first, we assume that the quintessence field does not exhibit fluctuations on cluster scales and below - homogeneous fluid; second, we assume that the field inside the overdensity collapses along with the dark matter - inhomogeneous fluid. The Eke, Navarro & Steinmetz prescription reveals, in general, higher halo concentrations in inhomogeneous dark energy models than in their homogeneous equivalents. Halo concentrations appear to be controlled by both changes in formation epochs of the halo cores as well as by differing virialisation overdensities. We derive physical halo properties in all models and discuss their observational implications. We examine two possible methods for comparing observations with theoretical predictions.

By numerically solving the evolution of gravitational waves during and after inflation up to the present, all of these effects can be examined comprehensively and accurately over a broad spectrum, even at very high frequencies.

Our model follows the accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside growing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angular momentum distributions. Models without feedback produce disks that are too small and rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies, resulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback can reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotation velocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabatic contraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass, but our successful models require 25% of the SN energy, or 100% of the SN momentum, to drive the outflows. It remains to be seen whether such high efficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy and momentum driven wind models result in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellar mass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. Observations favor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar = 10^{10.5} Msun, but the momentum driven wind model at high masses. The ratio between the specific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo, (j_gal/m_gal), is not unity in our models. Yet this is the standard assumption in models of disk galaxy formation. Feedback preferentially ejects low angular momentum material because star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii. This results in (j_gal/m_gal) increasing with decreasing halo mass. This effect helps to resolve the discrepancy between the high spin parameters observed for dwarf galaxies with the low spin parameters predicted from LCDM.

Our model follows the accretion, cooling, and ejection of baryonic mass, as a function of radius, inside growing dark matter haloes. The surface density profile of the disk is determined by detailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of specific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations. Exponential and quasi-exponential disks can be produced by our model through a combination of supernova driven galactic outflows (which preferentially remove low angular momentum material), intrinsic variation in the angular momentum distribution of the halo gas, and the inefficiency of star formation at large radii. We use observations from the SDSS NYU-VAGC to show that the median Sersic index of blue galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For blue galaxies, low mass galaxies have a median n=1.3, while high mass galaxies have a median n=4. Our model with energy driven outflows correctly reproduces this trend, whereas our models with momentum driven outflows and no outflows over predict the Sersic indices in low mass galaxies. We show that the observed fraction of \"bulge-less\" exponential galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass. For Milky-Way mass galaxies less than 0.1% of blue galaxies are bulge-less, whereas for M33 mass galaxies bulge-less and quasi-bulgeless galaxies are typical. These results suggest that the difficulty of hierarchical formation models to produce bulge-less Milky-Way mass galaxies is in fact not a problem.

The nice agreement between simulated data and theoretical expectations based on the spherical collapse model support such a conjecture. The late and long period where a slow decrease of the phase-space density occurs is related to accretion and merger episodes. The study of some merger events in the phase-space (radial velocity versus radial distance) reveals the formation of structures quite similar to caustics generated in secondary infall models of halo formation.

It depends, however, on Lorentz invariance and transparency. Transparency can be affected by intergalactic dust or interactions between photons and the dark sector. Baryon acoustic feature and type Ia supernovae measures of the expansion history are differently sensitive to the angular diameter and luminosity distances and can therefore be used in conjunction to limit cosmic transparency.

Such a configuration can produce rapid variability at large distances from the central engine via reflections of the converging recollimation shock. Possible applications of this model to TeV blazars are discussed. We then apply our model to M87. The low radiative efficiency of the M87 jet renders focusing unlikely.

We measure the 2nd-order auto- and cross-correlation functions of galaxy clustering and express the relative biasing by using aperture statistics. Also estimated is the relation between the galaxies and the dark matter distribution exploiting galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). All observables are further interpreted in terms of a halo model. To fully explain the galaxy clustering cross-correlation function with a halo model, we need to introduce a new parameter,R, that describes the statistical relation between numbers of red and blue galaxies within the same halo. We find that red and blue galaxies are clearly differently clustered, a significant evolution of the relative clustering with redshift was not found. There is evidence for a scale-dependence of relative biasing. The relative clustering, the GGL and, with some tension, the galaxy numbers can be explained consistently within a halo model. For the cross-correlation function one requires a HOD variance that becomes Poisson even for relatively small occupancy numbers. For our sample, this rules out with high confidence a \"Poisson satellite\" scenario as found in semi-analytical models. Red galaxies have to be concentrated towards the halo centre, either by a central red galaxy or by a concentration parameter above that for dark matter.The value of R depends on the presence or absence of central galaxies: If no central galaxies or only red central galaxies are allowed, R is consistent with zero, whereas a positive correlation $R=+0.5\\pm0.2$ is needed if both blue and red galaxies can have central galaxies.[ABRIDGED]", "published": "2008-05-22T13:24:43+00:00", "updated": "2009-05-01T11:39:18+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3459v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14973.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14973.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3459v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0805.3459v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

In order to do this we carefully define local and global estimators of the density around galaxies. The former are computed using a voronoi tessellation technique and the latter are parameterised by the normalised distance to haloes and voids, in terms of the virial and void radii, respectively. As a function of local density, galaxies show a strong modulation in their SF, a result that is in agreement with those from several authors. When taking subsamples of equal local density at different large-scale environments, we find relevant global effects whereby the fraction of red galaxies diminishes for galaxies in equal local density environments farther away from clusters and closer to voids. In general, the semianalytic simulation is in good agreement with the available observational results, and offers the possibility to disentangle many of the processes responsible for the variation of galaxy properties with the environment; we find that the changes found in samples of galaxies with equal local environment but different distances to haloes or voids come from the variations in the underlying mass function of dark-matter haloes.

Given the observed AGN luminosity function, a model for AGN lifetimes (time above a given luminosity) translates directly to a predicted Eddington ratio distribution. Models for self-regulated BH growth, in which feedback produces a 'blowout' decay phase after some peak luminosity (shutting down accretion) make specific predictions for the lifetimes distinct from those expected if AGN are simply gas starved (without feedback) and very different from simple phenomenological 'light bulb' models. Present observations of the Eddington ratio distribution, spanning 5 decades in Eddington ratio, 3 in BH mass, and redshifts z=0-1, agree with the predictions of self-regulated models, and rule out 'light-bulb', pure exponential, and gas starvation models at high significance. We compare the Eddington ratio distributions at fixed BH mass and fixed luminosity (both are consistent, but the latter are much less constraining). We present empirical fits to the lifetime distribution and show how the Eddington ratio distributions place tight limits on AGN lifetimes at various luminosities. We use this to constrain the shape of the typical AGN lightcurve, and provide simple analytic fits.

Such a signal is generally expected from dark matter annihilations. However, the hard positron spectrum and large amplitude are difficult to achieve in most conventional WIMP models. The absence of any associated excess in anti-protons is highly constraining on any model with hadronic annihilation modes. We revisit an earlier proposal, whereby the dark matter annihilates into a new light (<~GeV) boson phi, which is kinematically constrained to go to hard leptonic states, without anti-protons or pi0's. We find this provides a very good fit to the data. The light boson naturally provides a mechanism by which large cross sections can be achieved through the Sommerfeld enhancement, as was recently proposed.

They are potentially important for affecting protoplanetary migration through the action of associated stochastic gravitational forces and producing residual transport in MHD inactive regions. The simulations we perform are with zero net flux and produce mean activity levels of alpha ~ 0.005. We reveal the nature of the mechanism responsible for the excitation of these waves by determining the time dependent evolution of the Fourier transforms of the participating state variables. The dominant waves are found to have no vertical structure and to be excited during periodically repeating swings in which they change from leading to trailing. The initial phase of the evolution of such a swing is found to be in excellent agreement with that expected from the WKBJ theory developed in a preceding paper by Heinemann & Papaloizou. We demonstrate that the important source terms causing excitation of the waves are related to a quantity that reduces to the potential vorticity for small perturbations from the background state with no vertical dependence. We find that the root mean square density fluctuations associated with the waves are positively correlated with both this quantity and the general level of hydromagnetic turbulence.

We formulate a set of wave equations with sources that are only non-zero in the presence of turbulent fluctuations. We solve these in a shearing box domain using a WKBJ method. It is found that, for a particular azimuthal wave length, the wave excitation occurs through a sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in shearing discs with turbulence. Trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating in opposite directions are produced, both of which produce an outward angular momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters and azimuthal wave length. By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically we justify the WKBJ approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In order to quantify the wave excitation completely the important wave source terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak nonlinearity, these can be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime.

By requiring that the coupled system of perturbation equations for \\delta\\rho_M and \\delta\\rho_D has a smooth solution throughout the entire cosmological evolution, that the matter power spectrum is consistent with the data on structure formation and that the \"coincidence ratio\" r=\\rho_D/\\rho_M stays bounded and not unnaturally high, we are able to determine a well-defined region of the parameter space where the model can solve the cosmic coincidence problem in full compatibility with all known cosmological data.", "published": "2008-09-20T08:05:23+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-29T07:40:51+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3462v5", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.79.043006", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.79.043006", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3462v5", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3462v5"], "journal_reference": "Phys.Rev.D79:043006,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

This model is relevant to multi-component superconductors, antiferromagnetic spin systems in easy plane, inflational cosmology, etc. It is known that there is no phase transition in the N=1 model. For N=2, we found that the system has a second-order phase transition line $\\tilde{c}_1(c_2)$ in the $c_2$(gauge coupling)$-c_1$(Higgs coupling) plane, which separates the confinement phase and the Higgs phase. Numerical results suggest that the phase transition belongs to the universality class of the 3D XY model as the previous works by Babaev et al. and Smiseth et al. suggested. For N=3, we found that there exists a critical line similar to that in the N=2 model, but the critical line is separated into two parts; one for $c_2 < c_{2{\\rm tc}}=2.4\\pm 0.1$ with first-order transitions, and the other for $ c_{2{\\rm tc}} < c_2$ with second-order transitions, indicating the existence of a tricritical point. We verified that similar phase diagram appears for the N=4 and N=5 systems. We also studied the case of anistropic Higgs coupling in the N=3 model and found that there appear two second-order phase transitions or a single second-order transition and a crossover depending on the values of the anisotropic Higgs couplings.

While this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the greatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer the problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA and by ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonable assumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of simple benchmark models for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed in the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a single pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for the ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain both experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of mature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single, younger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and less plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more distant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars. We list several candidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute to explain the PAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we find that the contribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could contribute for the ATIC excess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and decisive role that Fermi-LAT will play in the very near future by (1) providing an exquisite measurement of the e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and (3) searching for anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.", "published": "2008-12-23T22:07:34+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-28T20:22:37+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4457v2", "doi": "10.2478/s11534-011-0099-z", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11534-011-0099-z", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4457v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4457v2"], "journal_reference": "Central European Journal of Physics Volume 10, Number 1, 1-31\n  (2011)", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph", "hep-ph", "hep-th"]}

Jackson"], "summary": "The properties of Galactic molecular clouds tabulated by Solomon etal (1987) (SRBY) are re-examined using the Boston University-FCRAO Galactic Ring Survey of 13CO J=1-0 emission. These new data provide a lower opacity tracer of molecular clouds and improved angular and spectral resolution than previous surveys of molecular line emission along the Galactic Plane. We calculate GMC masses within the SRBY cloud boundaries assuming LTE conditions throughout the cloud and a constant H2 to 13CO abundance, while accounting for the variation of the 12C/13C with Galacto-centric radius. The LTE derived masses are typically five times smaller than the SRBY virial masses. The corresponding median mass surface density of molecular hydrogen for this sample is 42 Msun/pc^2, which is significantly lower than the value derived by SRBY (median 206 Msun/pc^2) that has been widely adopted by most models of cloud evolution and star formation. This discrepancy arises from both the extrapolation by SRBY of velocity dispersion, size, and CO luminosity to the 1K antenna temperature isophote that likely overestimates the GMC masses and our assumption of constant 13CO abundance over the projected area of each cloud. Owing to the uncertainty of molecular abundances in the envelopes of clouds, the mass surface density of giant molecular clouds could be larger than the values derived from our 13CO measurements. From velocity dispersions derived from the 13CO data, we find that the coefficient of the cloud structure functions, vo=sigma_v/R^{1/2}, is not constant, as required to satisfy Larson's scaling relationships, but rather systematically varies with the surface density of the cloud as Sigma^{0.5} as expected for clouds in self-gravitational equlibrium.", "published": "2008-09-08T18:15:36+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-28T18:18:02+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1397v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/1092", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/1092", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1397v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.1397v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.699:1092-1103,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

In the case of a spherically symmetric outflow that is isothermal and expanding at constant radial speed, the radiative transfer for the continuum emission from a dense wind is analytic. Even the emission profile shape for a recombination line can be derived. Key to these derivations is that the opacity scales with only the square of the density. These results are well-known. Here an extension of the derivation is developed that also allows for line blends and the inclusion of an additional power-law dependence beyond just the density dependence. The additional power-law is promoted as a representation of a radius dependent clumping factor. It is shown that differences in the line widths and equivalent widths of the emission lines depend on the steepness of the clumping power-law.

We simulate the SMBH mass function at redshift z=6 using dark matter (DM) halo merger trees, coupled with a prescription for the halo occupation fraction, accretion histories, and radial recoil trajectories of the growing BHs.

Many models have been suggested for their formation, but these encounter difficulties explaining their observed characteristics. Here we show that secular perturbations by the Sun (Kozai mechanism) fundamentally change the evolution and the initial distribution of BMPs predicted by such models and lead to unique observational signatures. The Kozai mechanism can lead to a large periodic oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of highly inclined BMP orbits, where we predict such effects to be observable with current accuracy within a few years (e.g. for the binary asteroid Huenna). In addition, the combined effects of the Kozai mechanism and tidal friction (KCTF) drives BMPs into short period circular orbits. We predict a specific inclination dependent distribution of the separation and eccentricity of BMPs, due to these effects, including a zone of avoidance at the highest inclinations. Specifically the Kozai evolution could explain the recently observed peculiar orbit of the Kuiper belt binary 2001 QW322 . Additionally, the KCTF process could lead to BMPs coalescence and serve as an important route for the formation of irregular shaped single minor planets with large axial tilts.", "published": "2008-09-12T08:07:42+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-28T05:53:11+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2095v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/L17", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/L17", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2095v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2095v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

The LXCDM model was proposed as an interesting solution to the cosmic coincidence problem. It includes an extra dynamical component, the \"cosmon\" X, which interacts with the running \\Lambda, but not with matter. In our analysis we make use of the current value of the linear bias parameter, b^2(0)= P_{GG}/P_{MM}, where P_{MM} ~ (\\delta\\rho/\\rho)^2 is the present matter power spectrum and P_{GG} is the galaxy fluctuation power spectrum. The former can be computed within a given model, and the latter is found from the observed LSS data (at small z) obtained by the 2dF galaxy redshift survey. It is found that b^2(0)=1 within a 10% accuracy for the standard LCDM model. Adopting this limit for any DE model and using a method based on the effective equation of state for the DE, we can set a limit on the growth of matter density perturbations for the running LCDM model, the solution of which is known. This provides a good test of the procedure, which we then apply to the LXCDM model in order to determine the physical region of parameter space, compatible with the LSS data.

We also examine the distribution of the scatter for merging and nonmerging populations, identified using halo merger trees derived from the simulation as well as X-ray substructure measures. We find a strong correlation between the scatter in the M-T_X relation and the halo concentration, in the sense that more concentrated clusters tend to be cooler than clusters with similar masses. No bias is found between the merging and relaxed clusters, but merging clusters generally have greater scatter, which is related to the properties of the distribution of halo concentrations. We also detect a signature of non-lognormality in the distribution of scatter for our simulated clusters both at z=0 and at z=1. A detailed comparison of merging clusters identified by substructure measures and by halo merger trees is given in the discussion. We conclude that, when cooling-related effects are neglected, the variation in halo concentrations is a more important factor for driving the intrinsic scatter in the M-T_X relation, while departures from hydrostatic equilibrium due to cluster mergers have a minor effect.", "published": "2008-08-29T17:37:57+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-27T20:43:22+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.4099v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/315", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/699/1/315", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.4099v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.4099v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.699:315-329,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Heckman"], "summary": "We analyze the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion rates peaked at about one percent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.", "published": "2008-12-05T21:17:08+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-27T15:57:58+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1224v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14960.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14960.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1224v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.1224v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

General formulas are given which do not depend on any assumption linking the tidal lags to the frequencies of the corresponding tidal waves (except that equal frequency harmonics are assumed to span equal lags). Emphasis is given to the cases of companions having reached one of the two possible final states: (1) the super-synchronous stationary rotation resulting from the vanishing of the average tidal torque; (2) the capture into a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (true synchronization). In these cases, the energy dissipation is controlled by the tidal harmonic with period equal to the orbital period (instead of the semi-diurnal tide) and the singularity due to the vanishing of the geometric phase lag does not exist. It is also shown that the true synchronization with non-zero eccentricity is only possible if an extra torque exists opposite to the tidal torque. The theory is developed assuming that this additional torque is produced by an equatorial permanent asymmetry in the companion. The results are model-dependent and the theory is developed only to the second degree in eccentricity and inclination (obliquity). It can easily be extended to higher orders, but formal accuracy will not be a real improvement as long as the physics of the processes leading to tidal lags is not better known.", "published": "2007-12-07T15:12:39+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-27T12:55:05+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1156v3", "doi": "10.1007/s10569-008-9133-x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10569-008-9133-x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1156v3", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.1156v3"], "journal_reference": "Celest.Mech.Dyn.Astron.101:171-197,2008", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

Comparing our current observed number of clusters shows good agreement with predictions. We determine the expected degradation of the constraints as a result of self-calibrating the luminosity-temperature relation (with scatter), including temperature measurement errors, and relying on photometric methods for the estimation of galaxy cluster redshifts.

Using only (T,z) self-calibration, we expect to measure Omega_m to +-0.03 (and Omega_Lambda to the same accuracy assuming flatness), and sigma_8 to +-0.05, also constraining the normalization and slope of the luminosity-temperature relation to +-6 and +-13 per cent (at 1sigma) respectively in the process. Self-calibration fails to jointly constrain the scatter and redshift evolution of the luminosity-temperature relation significantly. Additional archival and/or follow-up data will improve on this.

The Suzaku data, which have continuous coverage of more than one orbital period, show strong modulation of the X-ray emission at the orbital period of this TeV gamma-ray emitting system.The X-ray emission shows a minimum at orbital phase ~ 0.1, close to the so-called superior conjunction of the compact object, and a maximum at phase ~0.7, very close to the inferior conjunction of the compact object. The X-ray spectral data up to 70 keV are described by a hard power-law with a phase-dependent photon index which varies within Gamma ~1.45 - 1.61. The amplitude of the flux variation is a factor of 2.5, but is significantly less than that of the factor ~8 variation in the TeV flux. Otherwise the two light curves are similar, but not identical. Although periodic X-ray emission has been found from many galactic binary systems, the Suzaku result implies a phenomenon different from the \"standard\" origin of X-rays related to the emission of the hot accretion plasma formed around the compact companion object. The X-ray radiation of LS5039is likely to be linked to very-high-energy electrons which are also responsible for the TeV gamma-ray emission. While the gamma-rays are the result of inverse Compton scattering by electrons on optical stellar photons, X-rays are produced via synchrotron radiation.

The electric field is digitized by antennas on a rectangular grid, after which a series of Fast Fourier Transforms recovers simultaneous multifrequency images of up to half the sky. Thanks to Moore's law, the bandwidth up to which this is feasible has now reached about 1 GHz, and will likely continue doubling every couple of years. The main advantages over a single dish telescope are cost and orders of magnitude larger field-of-view, translating into dramatically better sensitivity for large-area surveys.

While weak lensing cannot resolve cluster cores and strong lensing is almost insensitive to density profiles outside the scale radius, combinations of both effects promise to constrain density profiles of galaxy clusters well, and thus to allow testing of the CDM expectation on dark-matter halo density profiles. METHODS. We develop an algorithm further that we had recently proposed for this purpose. It recovers a lensing potential optimally reproducing observations of both strong and weak-lensing effects by combining high resolution in cluster cores with the larger-scale information from weak lensing. The main extensions concern the accommodation of mild non-linearity in inner iterations, the progressive increase in resolution in outer iterations, and the introduction of a suitable regularisation term. The linearity of the method is essentially preserved. RESULTS. We demonstrate the success of the algorithm with both idealised and realistic simulated data, showing that the simulated lensing mass distribution and its density profile are well reproduced.

Six maxima of integrated line intensity are detected which we designate Oph A-N1 through N6. The N4 and N5 maxima are coincident with the starless continuum objects SM1 and SM2 respectively but the other maxima are not coincident with previously-identified objects. In contrast, relatively little N2H+ 1-0 emission is coincident with the starless object SM2 and the Class 0 protostar VLA 1623. The FWHM of the N2H+ 1-0 line, Delta V, varies by a factor of ~5 across Oph A. Values of Delta V < 0.3 km/s are found in 14 locations in Oph A, but only that associated with N6 is both well-defined spatially and larger than the beam size. Centroid velocities of the line, V_LSR, vary relatively little, having an rms of only \\~0.17 km/s. Small-scale V_LSR gradients of <0.5 km/s over ~0.01 pc are found near SM1, SM1N, and SM2, but not N6. The low N2H+ abundances of SM2 or VLA 1623 relative to SM1, SM1N, or N6 may reflect relatively greater amounts of N2 adsorption onto dust grains in their colder and probably denser interiors. The low Delta V of N6, i.e., 0.193 km/s FWHM, is only marginally larger than the FWHM expected from thermal motions alone, suggesting turbulent motions in the Oph A core have been reduced dramatically at this location.

The initial conditions of the encounters are consistent with the LambdaCDM paradigm of structure formation, and the simulations include the effects of radiative cooling, star formation, and supernovae feedback. We find that the pairing of SMBHs depends sensitively on the amount of baryonic mass preserved in the center of the companion galaxies during the last phases of the merger. In particular, due to the combination of gasdynamics and star formation, we find that a pair of SMBHs can form in 1:10 minor mergers provided that galaxies are relatively gas-rich (gas fractions of 30% of the disk mass) and that the mergers occur at relatively high redshift (z~3), when dynamical friction timescales are shorter.

Gergely"], "summary": "The high value of brane tension has a crucial role in recovering Einstein's general relativity at low energies. In the framework of a recently developed formalism with variable brane tension one can pose the question, whether it was always that high? In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper we allow for temperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law established by E\\\"otv\\\"os. For cosmological branes this assumption leads to several immediate consequences: (a) The brane Universe was created at a finite temperature $T_{c}$ and scale factor $a_{\\min}$. (b) Both the brane tension and the 4-dimensional gravitational coupling 'constant' increase with the scale factor from zero to asymptotic values. (c) The 4-dimensional cosmological 'constant' evolves with $a$, starting with a huge negative value, passing through zero, finally reaching a small positive value. Such a scale-factor dependent cosmological constant is able to generate a surplus of attraction at small $a$ (as dark matter does) and a late-time repulsion at large $a$ (dark energy). In the particular toy model discussed here the evolution of the brane tension is compensated by energy interchange between the brane and the fifth dimension, such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid. The resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times, a decelerated phase being followed by an accelerated expansion.

Doppler shifts from the host galaxy redshifts are systematically searched for in the Na I 5890,96 doublet (Na D). Although the spectral resolution and S/N limit us to study the interstellar gas kinematics from fitting a single doublet component to each observed Na D profile, the typical outflow often seen in local luminous-infrared galaxies (LIRGs) should be detected at >~ 6 sigma in absorption equivalent width down to the survey limiting S/N (~ 5 per pixel) in the continuum around Na D. The detection rate of LIRG-like outflow clearly shows an increasing trend with star-forming activity and infrared luminosity. However, by virtue of not selecting our sample on star formation, we also find a majority of outflows in galaxies on the red sequence in the rest-frame (U-B, M_B) color-magnitude diagram. Most of these red-sequence outflows are of early-type morphology and show the sign of recent star formation in their UV-optical colors; some show enhanced Balmer H-beta absorption lines indicative of poststarburst as well as high dust extinction. These findings demonstrate that outflows outlive starbursts and suggest that galactic-scale outflows play a role in quenching star formation in the host galaxies on their way to the red sequence. The fate of relic winds, as well as the observational constraints on gaseous feedback models, may be studied in galaxies during their poststarburst phase. We also note the presence of inflow candidates in red, early-type galaxies, some with signs of AGNs/LINERs but little evidence for star formation.", "published": "2008-04-28T02:53:28+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-20T21:06:46+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.4312v2", "doi": "10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/214", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/696/1/214", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4312v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.4312v2"], "journal_reference": "Astrophys.J.696:214-232,2009", "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

They are investigated by studying the exact two-fields dynamics instead of assuming slow-roll. When the field values are restricted to be less than the reduced Planck mass, a non-negligible part of the initial condition space (around 15% depending on potential parameters) leads to successful inflation. Most of it is located outside the usual inflationary valley and organized in continuous patterns instead of being isolated as previously found. Their existence is explained and their properties are studied. This shows that no excessive fine-tuning is required for successful hybrid inflation. Moreover, by extending the initial condition space to planckian-like or super-planckian values, inflation becomes generically sufficiently long and can produce a red-tilted scalar power spectrum due to slow-roll violations. The robustness of these properties is confirmed by conducting our analysis on three other models of hybrid-type inflation in various framework: \"smooth\" and \"shifted\" inflation in SUSY and SUGRA, and \"radion assisted\" gauge inflation.

We investigate the instability using N-body simulations, and show that it can drive individual orbital eccentricities to significantly higher or lower values on the order of a precession time-scale. This physics is relevant for the Galactic center, where massive stars are likely to form in eccentric disks around the SgrA* black hole. We show that the observed bimodal eccentricity distribution of disk stars in the Galactic center is in good agreement with the distribution resulting from the eccentricity instability and demonstrate how the dynamical evolution of such a disk results in several of its stars acquiring high (1-e < 0.1) orbital eccentricity.

We firmly detected K-shell emission from Fe, for the first time, and find that the Fe ionization state is quite low. The broad band spectrum extracted from the southeast of the remnant is well fitted with a model consisting of three optically thin thermal non-equilibrium ionization plasmas and a power-law component.

These components have different ionization parameters: $n_et \\sim 1.4\\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s and $n_et \\sim 7.7\\times 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ s and it is the later one that produces the Fe-K emission. This suggests that Fe has been heated by the reverse shock more recently than the other elements, consistent with a picture where the ejecta are stratified by composition with Fe in the interior.

With the spatial and spectral analysis, we separated the X-rays into three distinct components; low (kT_e~0.3keV) and high (kT_e~1.8keV) temperature plasmas and a non-thermal component, and discovered their spatial distributions are different from each other. The low temperature plasma is dominated at the east rim, whereas the non-thermal emission is the brightest at the northeast rim which is spatially connected from the east rim. The high temperature plasma, found to contain the ~6.42keV line (K alpha of low-ionized iron), is enhanced at the inward region with respect to the east rim and has no spatial correlation with the non-thermal X-ray (the northeast). The Fe-Kalpha line, therefore, is not related to the non-thermal emission but originates from Fe-rich ejecta heated to the high temperatures by the reverse shock. Since the metal abundances of the low temperature plasma are sub-solar, the most possible origin of this component is interstellar medium heated by a blast wave. The non-thermal X-ray, which has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. A possible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: A fast moving blast wave in a thin cavity of OB association collided with a dense interstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. As the result, the reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the Fe-rich region of the ejecta and heated it.

Furthermore, we investigate the relations between the scalar field theories with realizing a crossing of the phantom divide and the corresponding modified gravitational theories by using the inverse conformal transformation. It is demonstrated that the scalar field theories describing the non-phantom phase (phantom one with the Big Rip) can be represented as the theories of real (complex) $F(R)$ gravity through the inverse (complex) conformal transformation.

In spite of extensive observational efforts, these questions remain to be answered and are difficult or even impossible to infer with the spectral and lightcurve information currently collected. Polarization measurements will lead to unambiguous answers to several of these questions. Recent developments in X-ray and gamma-ray polarimetry techniques have demonstrated a significant increase in sensitivity enabling several new mission concepts, e.g. POET (Polarimeters for Energetic Transients), providing wide field of view and broadband polarimetry measurements. If launched, missions of this kind would finally provide definitive measurements of GRB polarizations. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to derive the distribution of GRB polarizations in three emission models; the synchrotron model with a globally ordered magnetic field (SO model), the synchrotron model with a locally random magnetic field (SR model), and the Compton drag model (CD model). The results show that POET, or other polarimeters with similar capabilities, can constrain the GRB emission models by using the statistical properties of GRB polarizations. In particular, the ratio of the number of GRBs for which the polarization degrees can be measured to the number of GRBs that are detected (N_m/N_d) and the distributions of the polarization degrees (Pi) can be used as the criteria. If N_m/N_d > 30% and Pi is clustered between 0.2 and 0.7, the SO model will be favored. If instead N_m/N_d < 15%, then the SR or CD model will be favored.

For example, taking into account uncertainties in the available observational data, both produce a realistic morphological mix today, but its evolution is very different. A main cause of this and other differences is the treatment of disk instabilities which play a more prominent role in the Durham model. Our analysis confirms previous theoretical predictions that elliptical galaxies form most of their stars before the bulk of the galaxy is assembled. Spirals tend to have later `assembly' times as a consequence of in-situ star formation. With the exception of the brightest ellipticals (stellar mass > 2.5e11 M_sun/h), we find that major mergers are not the primary mechanism by which most spheroids (ellipticals and spiral bulges) assemble their mass. In fact, the majority of ellipticals (and the overwhelming majority of spirals) never experience a major merger (above the resolution limit of our simulation.) Most ellipticals and spiral bulges acquire their stellar mass through minor mergers or disk instabilities. These conclusions are common to both models. The rotation properties of spheroids may help to constrain the importance of disk instabilities in these models.", "published": "2008-06-26T09:19:50+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-16T10:19:10+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4189v2", "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14921.x", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14921.x", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4189v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.4189v2"], "journal_reference": null, "primary_category": "astro-ph", "categories": ["astro-ph"]}

We used the high-resolution spectograph SOPHIE mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to obtain 55 spectra of HD 189733 over nearly two months.

The purpose of this work is to fairly and critically review in great detail every distance method used for these two microquasars in order to show that the distances of probably all microquasars in our galaxy are much more uncertain than currently admitted. Moreover, we show that many confirmations of quantitative results are often entangled and rely on very uncertain measurements. We also present a new determination of the maximum distance of GRO J1655-40 using red clump giant stars, and show that it confirms our earlier result of a distance less than 2 kpc instead of 3.2 kpc. Since it then becomes more likely that GRO J1655-40 could originate from the stellar cluster NGC 6242, located at 1.0 kpc, we review the distance estimations of A0620-00, which is so far the closest black hole with an average distance of about 1.0 kpc. We show that the distance methods used for A0620-00 are also problematic. Finally, we present a new analysis of spectroscopic and astrometric archival data on this microquasar, and apply the maximum-distance method of Foellmi et al. (2006).

The extinction mapping technique requires modeling the IR background intensity behind the cloud, which is achieved by correcting for foreground emission and then interpolating from the surrounding regions. The correction for foreground emission can be quite large, thus restricting the utility of this technique to relatively nearby clouds. We investigate three methods for the interpolation, finding systematic differences at about the 10% level, which, for fiducial dust models, corresponds to a mass surface density Sigma = 0.013 g cm^-2, above which we conclude this extinction mapping technique attains validity. We examine the probability distribution function of Sigma in IRDCs. From a qualitative comparison with numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence, many clouds appear to have relatively narrow distributions suggesting relatively low (<5) Mach numbers and/or dynamically strong magnetic fields. Given cloud kinematic distances, we derive cloud masses. Rathborne, Jackson & Simon identified cores within the clouds and measured their masses via mm dust emission. For 43 cores, we compare these mass estimates with those derived from our extinction mapping, finding good agreement: typically factors of <~2 difference for individual cores and an average systematic offset of <~10% for the adopted fiducial assumptions of each method.

Hogg"], "summary": "A common belief about big-bang cosmology is that the cosmological redshift cannot be properly viewed as a Doppler shift (that is, as evidence for a recession velocity), but must be viewed in terms of the stretching of space. We argue that, contrary to this view, the most natural interpretation of the redshift is as a Doppler shift, or rather as the accumulation of many infinitesimal Doppler shifts. The stretching-of-space interpretation obscures a central idea of relativity, namely that it is always valid to choose a coordinate system that is locally Minkowskian. We show that an observed frequency shift in any spacetime can be interpreted either as a kinematic (Doppler) shift or a gravitational shift by imagining a suitable family of observers along the photon's path. In the context of the expanding universe the kinematic interpretation corresponds to a family of comoving observers and hence is more natural.", "published": "2008-08-07T17:50:32+00:00", "updated": "2009-04-14T15:21:40+00:00", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1081v2", "doi": "10.1119/1.3129103", "links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.3129103", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.1081v2", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1081v2"], "journal_reference": "Am.J.Phys.77:688-694,2009", "primary_category": "physics.pop-ph", "categories": ["physics.pop-ph", "astro-ph", "gr-qc", "physics.ed-ph"]}

We adopt a new \"dwarf spheroidal model\" in which the SMC initially has both old stars with a spherical spatial distribution and an extended HI gas disk. We mainly investigate SMC's evolution for the last 3 Gyr within which the Magellanic stream (MS) and the Magellanic bridge (MB) can be formed as a result of the LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction. Our principal results, which can be tested against observations, are as follows. The final spatial distribution of the old stars projected onto the sky is spherical even after the strong LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction, whereas that of the new ones is significantly flattened and appears to form a bar structure. Old stars have the line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma) of ~ 30 km/s and slow rotation with the maximum rotational velocity (V) of less than slow rotation with the maximum rotational velocity (V) of less than 20 km/s and show asymmetry in the radial profiles. New stars have a smaller sigma than old ones and a significant amount of rotation (V/sigma >1). HI gas shows velocity dispersions of sigma = 10-40 km/s a high maximum rotational velocity (V ~ 50 km/s), and the spatial distribution similar to that of new stars.

We show that the mass ($M_{\\rm dm}$) and the mean density (${\\rho}_{\\rm dm}$) of the dark matter halo within the optical radius ($\\sim 3$ kpc) of the SMC can be significantly low for $M_{\\rm s}/L_{\\rm V}=2-4$ reasonable for a galaxy dominated by older stellar populations.

Teplitz"], "summary": "(abridged) We present deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, along with 16, 24, 70, and 850um photometry, for 22 galaxies located in GOODS-N. The sample spans a redshift range of 0.6 < z < 2.6, 24um flux densities between ~0.2-1.2 mJy, and consists of SMGs, AGN, and optically faint (z_AB > 25) sources. We find that IR luminosities derived by fitting local SEDs with 24um photometry alone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and longer wavelength photometric data is used for galaxies having z < 1.4 and 24um-derived IR luminosities typically > 3x10^12 L_sun. However, for galaxies in the redshift range between 1.4 < z < 2.6, typically having 24um-derived IR luminosities > 3x10^12 L_sun, IR luminosities are overestimated by an average factor of ~5 when SED fitting with 24um photometry alone. This result arises partly due to the fact that high redshift galaxies exhibit PAH EQWs that are large compared to local galaxies of similar luminosities. Using improved estimates for the IR luminosities of these sources, we investigate whether their IR emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based on extinction corrected UV SFRs, possibly suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN. Through a spectral decomposition of IRS spectroscopic data, we are able to isolate the fraction of IR luminosity arising from an AGN as opposed to star formation activity. This fraction is only ~30% of the total IR luminosity among the entire sample, on average. Of the sources identified as having mid-infrared excesses, half are accounted for by using proper bolometric corrections while half show the presence of obscured AGN.
